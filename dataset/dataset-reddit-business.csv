924,"Former employee is now frequently returning to the job, stealing things, and then leaving. Police won’t do anything.","So a couple of months ago, I had to fire an employee after he got caught stealing from our job. We could have pressed charges then, but didn’t. Honestly, I felt more sorry for him than anything, because he’s poor and probably desperate to earn money to support his family. That sympathy was quickly eroded once I found out that he has been making frequent stops where he would come into our front lobby area and steal things that he could resale. Mostly packages that get delivered to us. Because of the nature of our business, we get sent dozens of packages a day. And our delivery people, despite being asked not to, just drop our packages in the front lobby area where anyone can just walk in and take them. I thought about getting a mag lock/keypad put on our door, but they cost thousands of dollars and we just can’t afford them right now. I tried filing a police report, but the police are basically useless in this situation. Multiple witnesses have seen him steal boxes, but that’s not enough to make a case. We ordered some security cameras so we could catch him in the act, but it looks like….wait for it…he stole those, too! This has been going on for weeks. It seems like there would be an easy solution to this problem, but I honestly don’t know what to do.  EDIT: I should elaborate on why the police haven’t done anything. Because the property that this guy is trespassing on is a business, we need specific paperwork stating that he is not allowed to come here (forgot what it’s called). The only way to get that is to have an officer present while I tell this person he’s not allowed to be here anymore. Obviously, this guy is going to be long gone by the time the police arrive. In order to arrest him for burglary, they need evidence i.e. video footage of him stealing. As of right now we don’t have cameras. So basically, they can’t do anything at the moment. I live in Tennessee in case anyone’s wondering.",,False,False,business
