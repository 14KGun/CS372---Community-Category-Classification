0,My kid just texted me üå≠,"It‚Äôs code for I want to come home, but I want it to be your fault. Any random emoji when we‚Äôre not texting each other will work. He was supposed to be staying the night with a friend, so I was concerned when I get this text after I‚Äôve already gone to bed. I called him and told him ‚Äúyou were supposed to unload the dishwasher before you left, now you‚Äôve lost your privilege of spending the night. I‚Äôll be there in five minutes, have your stuff gathered up.‚Äù He got in the car and I asked what‚Äôs up. He said his friend‚Äôs grandpa was making him feel uncomfortable, but he didn‚Äôt know how to tell the friend he wanted to leave, then he thanked me for getting him out of there. We will talk more tomorrow about why he felt uncomfortable (he said it wasn‚Äôt anything bad, grandpa was just acting weird), but for tonight I will just be grateful that he remembered that I would come if he used any emoji. I don‚Äôt know if this will be helpful, or even noticed, but I wanted to put it out there in case anyone needs ideas on getting their kids out of situations when the kid feels like they can‚Äôt talk.",,False,False,parenting
1,Being the hang out house for teenagers is better than I ever imagined.,"My kids are 18 and 16 and we have somehow managed to become the house that our kids and their friends all happily gather at. I am not really sure what we did to encourage this. My wife and I are in our mid/late 50s and about as far from cool as one can get but we are willing to put up with the noise, drive friends around, and buy extra food to feed the friends. We have a rule board that says, ""This is not a frat house, so clean up your own messes. Don't do anything that has a good chance of killing you because I don't have time to bury your body. Don't do anything illegal. I won't bail you out of jail. If you like coming here, don't do anything that would make your parents stop allowing you to come over."" The kids are good about respecting the rules. When a hole was put into the wall during a game of indoor soccer, a kid came down and asked for the spackle. When a late night board game involves the loser jumping into our pool, they wash the towels they used. When a late night baking session breaks out they always clean the dishes they used. Friday was graduation for the older one and the last day of junior year for my younger one. The younger one decided to have a bunch of friends over to celebrate. When the rain forced them inside they started cooking while watching the new Jackass movie. I came out of my room late at night and all of the lights in the house we off because they were playing a version of hide and seek that included using a small flashlight to find everyone. This morning I woke up to multiple bodies fast asleep in various parts of the house and the realization that this will soon be over hit me hard. My oldest goes to college this year and my younger will will be heading out next year. I am going to miss this so much. If you have young kids or preteens, don't be afraid of being the house they want to gather at. Yes, it can get loud and as an introvert I thought I would hate this but the payoff is worth it. Last night I knew my kid was safe. I get to know what is going on with them and their friends. A few years ago when my son was at a teammates house and was being pressured to smoke, he used me as an excuse to leave and his best friend followed along. I love that even their friends see our house as a safe place to come to. That has been so valuable and so worth the noise of a bunch of teens. I'm going to miss my kids when they leave but I will also miss their friends who have made our house their second home. Edit: This has been asked a bunch so I am clarifying here. We do not allow drugs or alcohol. That falls under the don't do anything illegal rule. Despite this we are still the hang out spot. The kids don't care about that.",,False,False,parenting
2,Update on: Nobody coming to my son's birthday party,"I posted a few weeks ago that nobody had RSVP'd to my son's 6th birthday party and I was kind of at a loss. People in this sub were so kind, supportive, generous, and overall very helpful. Today was the party and I wanted to update anyone who might be interested: I took the advice of many members in the group and cancelled the original reservation at an indoor venue, then booked a pavilion at an outdoor park to help reduce covid concerns. A couple days later, a parent did RSVP and I updated him on the venue change, then mentioned he was the only RSVP I'd gotten. This saint of a man worked some magic and reached out to a few parents from their JK class, who reached out to a couple more JK parents, and suddenly I was getting RSVP's. Also at the advice of this group, I did allow my son to give out invitations to his new kindergarten class (I was hesitant because they'd only known each other for not quite 2 full weeks) and got some RSVP's from there too. The party was today, and it was fantastic.  The park had a cool playground, a nice sandy beach, and the kids had a blast playing and swimming. Usually by this time of year it's cold, rainy, and possibly snowing, but we had sunshine and 84 degrees. It was perfect. Thank you for the ideas and support, it is so appreciated.",,False,False,parenting
3,My house burned down in the middle of the night with everyone inside. Here is what I wish I knew.,"A couple days go, our house burned down. It was in the middle of the night and a complete basic freak accident. We lost everything we owned.  I've learnt so much from this experience and I really want to share what I wish I knew before it happened. Fire drills are a thing. Practice, as a family, what to do in case of a fire. Come up with exit plans and practice at night time AND day time. Keep practicing until you're sure everyone in the family is comfortable with the plan and okay to get out. Emphasis on the whole 'Get out immediately and safely, don't grab anything.' Now, as a parent you need to realize that even if you practice this over and over and that everyone knows what to do, in the eventuality of an actual fire, things might just not go as planned. To give you a blunt example, our 9 year old was woken up and when we told him 'fire, let's go' his first reaction was to hide in our room. He was in a semi awake state where he figured it was just a dream and wanted shelter. Also, I cannot state this one enough MAKE SURE YOU GO OUT WITH YOUR KIDS. I told my kids (8 and 9) to go downstairs and out the door once I was sure there was no fire there. They were waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs. They were scared. They didn't want to go outside in the middle of the night without a parent. Don't rely on your children to go outside alone. 2. Don't let your children watch the house burn down. Hell, if you can avoid it, don't watch it yourself. It's traumatic. Ask a neighbor to keep them, a grandparent to pick them up, anything. You don't want them to go through the whole set of emotions of seeing everything they own being burnt.  Afterwards, experts have suggested us not to go back to the scene with them and definitely not to go inside. At that point, do what you feel comfortable with. 3. Consult. It's a traumatic event to go through. Therapy is healthy. 4. If you have pets and they happen to be in the house, remind the firefighters over and over. Each firefighter that goes inside, tell them there is a pet. Our pets all died (2 cats and 2 parrots). It was a big fire, so firefighters didn't make it a priority to save the pets BUT they also kept telling us they didn't know there were pets in the house. 5. Take the help that people give you. Don't try and go back to normal as quickly as possible. Take the time to process what happened. 6. Fireproof safes are a thing. Right now, I can't even identify myself. All my cards, wallet, passport, certificates are burnt. That's all. At the end of the day, I feel lucky to have my family alive. It took 10 minutes for the fire to reach the roof and the walls. By then, it was all collapsing. We also are very lucky to have gotten great support from family, friends and people we know. We're so thankful and I honestly cannot wait for the day that I can give back and help others.",,False,False,parenting
4,Took my 5F daughter to Target and got the cops called on me.,"My wife's cousin is having a wedding next week at her home/backyard only family. So today I took my daughter to find a nice sweater to go with her dress.. Anyway we are in the dressing room trying out some sweaters and she sees a spider and starts screaming. Me caught off guard trying to figure it out and finally have everything under control. But I guess some ladies were concerned about a little girl screaming and a man's voice with her. As we come out there are 4 cops there waiting for us. I immediately understood what was happening and it's 1 male cope 3 women cops. I do a heavy sigh and say she saw a spider it's fine. Well it's not fine. They try to grab my daughter and stand in front of them and explained I am her father and they are not allowed to touch her. I pulled my phone out and showed them some pictures that she is my daughter and a family photo. Meanwhile my daughter keeps saying ""Papi what's wrong?"" Well the woman who was concerned just grew angry because ""WHO MAKES A LITTLE GIRL CALL A GROWN MAN PAPI"" well I am Latino and Papi is for dad not some kink shit. Well... after 40 minutes of them checking the footage of me walking in with her and such they finally believe me and let us go. I called my wife after and tell her what happened. I get picked on a bit by people with my kids and it frustrates my wife because she feels I can't do stuff like normal parenting stuff without the cops being called. Like at the grocery store I took my daughter to the bathroom and came out to security and a lady trying to ""detain me"" about my intentions with my daughter. Anyway I know there are creeps and danger out in the world and one can't be too safe but it's tiring as a Dad to constantly navigate the world in this mindset.",,False,False,parenting
5,I don't enjoy being a father *update*,"About 6-7 weeks ago I wrote a post saying ""I don't enjoy being a father, I wrote it when I was upset and didn't know what I was doing. I felt lost, suicidal and I was really at the end of my tether. Your comments and kindness and advice were greatly appreciated and I took the time to read every single one. Afterwards I said to myself, only I can change this. I looked long and hard in the mirror, what could I do to improve my relationship with my daughter, its up to me to change. So I decided no matter what my daughter did. I wouldn't get angry, I'd listen more and even though she isn't communicating fully I tried to understand her better. The first week or two were pretty much the same. Hitting and screaming the house down. But I got on her level. I spoke softly to her. I didn't ask if she wanted to go and see the moon i made her come with me, if she cried I made sure I cuddled her and spoke softly and told her about the man in the moon, the stars in the sky. I did this every night. 4 weeks ago, everything and I mean everything changed. I was going to the shops and she said ""Dadda shop"" i was shocked. I asked if she wanted to come with me, she said yes. Her mother whom she wouldn't ever leave her side was shocked as well. We went shopping together and had fun. The week after we went to the zoo just the two of us and a week after to the play centre. I firmly believe I'm no longer ""Daddy a man who just lives in her house"" I'm now ""Daddy, her best friend (her words not mine) protector and tickle machine"" her demeanor has changed so much that now when I start work in the morning, (I work from home) she has been getting on my knee crying and saying ""Daddy, no work, Daddy play"". She started in the big room in nursery and my Girlfriend said she was hysterical her first day. But it was me she was asking for. I cannot believe the difference in her behaviour with me and it makes me so happy. I've gone from dreading seeing her because I don't know what her mood is to being genuinely excited to see her so we can play and learn together. It's taken me a while but I now am the Dad I'm going to be to her and she is going to love me for it. At least until she becomes a teenager anyway.üòÇ so to all off you, your kind words and advice. I thank you. Have a great Christmas and keep your families safe.",,False,False,parenting
6,Approached by a child therapist in Walmart after 2yo was throwing a fit for Kinetic Sand,"My daughter LOVES ‚Äúmagic sand‚Äù and we were specifically at Walmart for that. She earned a little prize. But, she wanted to open the package and play with it right then and there, and I‚Äôve been trying to teach her that we have to pay for things before we open them. She doesn‚Äôt understand that concept yet. So of course, she started screaming and throwing a fit from the toy section all the way to self check out which had somewhat of a line. The whole time I was telling her in a calm voice ‚Äúbaby, we can open it in the car‚Äù ‚Äúwe have to pay for it first, then we can open it‚Äù she kept crying ‚Äúplease mom can you please open it for me‚Äù and I kept saying ‚Äúno baby I‚Äôm sorry but those are the rules‚Äù and she would continue to scream and cry. I wasn‚Äôt too concerned about other people because I didn‚Äôt care. It didn‚Äôt seem like there were any Karens around and no one was staring so I figured I was okay. Every time someone finished their transaction, the light above the register would turn green, so I started trying to distract my daughter by saying ‚Äúoh look! That light just turned green, I wonder which one will turn green next, do you know? Let‚Äôs watch and see!‚Äù And it actually worked! She was still whimpering, but she turned around and started looking out for which one would turn green. It was finally our turn and as soon as we scanned it (let her scan it herself) I opened the package and gave her some sand. She stopped crying immediately and was so happy! As I was opening the sand, the lady who was in front of us came up to me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you this because no one else will. I‚Äôm a child therapist and what you did‚Ä¶ you did everything right. From talking to her calmly, explaining the rules, trying to distract her, everything you did was spot on, you‚Äôre doing a great job.‚Äù It really meant a lot to me because gentle parenting IS NOT EASY! It would‚Äôve been easy to yell at her, take her to the car, and spank her/scold her for ‚Äúbeing disruptive‚Äù. But mama don‚Äôt play that shit! I get shit from my bf‚Äôs family for not hitting her when she acts up and it‚Äôs tiring trying to explain that‚Äôs not healthy. My FIL once told me ‚Äúit WILL hurt you more than it‚Äôll ever hurt them. Just give her a pop in the mouth and watch how fast she shuts up‚Äù and at that time she was barely 1. I‚Äôm just happy I got some real outside validation on what a good job I‚Äôm doing raising my kid ü•∞",,False,False,parenting
7,"Forced ""Date Night"" yesterday","Hectic life my wife and I have. She works midnights and hi work days. My girls and I usually go 3 days without seeing her. It totally sucks but it pays the bills. I was getting dinner ready to throw in the crock pot while we cleaned the house. Had no plans because it was snowing. Girls in and out of the house playing in the snow and mailing messes in between. My girls (8 and 10) were scheming while we were cleaning. They made 2 sandwiches and didn't eat them. Just put them on paper played in the fridge. Odd. We're trying to clean up around them trying not to get upset while they are making more messes. Ripped paper and snacks everywhere. Somehow they got us upstairs, blindfolded and separated. They each picked out clothes for us to wear. Nice clothes. We changed and they staged an afternoon ""Date Night."" Brought us together in the living room where my wife was wearing a beautiful dress and I had a suit and tie on. Kids sat us down and put on a Netflix movie and we enjoyed the rest of the afternoon watching ""The Kissing Booth"" trilogy and ordering sandwiches and snacks from their snack bar as they waited on us. It was a much needed evening for all of us. Clean up starts today.",,False,False,parenting
8,"PSA: If you see a dad at the park, don't be afraid to talk to them. We are lonely.","Stay at home dad here. I regularly find myself as the only male parent when I take my son out somewhere. The moms tend to all strike up conversations with each other, but I often find them avoiding talking to me. This means I'm just generally sitting around quietly if my son is off playing. It's a lonely existence and being a stay at home means I don't get tons of socialization anyway. Yesterday my wife (who normally works) had the day off and went with me to the play space. When she was with our son the moms immediately began talking to her. Give us dads a chance, please!",,False,False,parenting
9,I don‚Äôt get why everyone thinks it‚Äôs so hard to put an infant to sleep.,"Maybe I‚Äôm just a natural parent, but it‚Äôs pretty straightforward. Just put him in the crib in a full swaddle with his pacifier. When he starts to cry, remove one arm from the swaddle. Now, he‚Äôll use that arm to knock out the pacifier. Put the pacifier back in, but make sure he doesn‚Äôt see you or he will wake up (alternatively, make sure he sees you so he knows you are there). Repeat this step 2-3 times. At this stage, he will be overtired and begin screaming. Remove him from the crib and swaddle, wait 10-15 minutes, then put him back in the swaddle (alternatively, don‚Äôt do this as it will make it worse).  Find his pacifier, which he has violently thrown across the room. Insert pacifier by delicately navigating his thrashing arms. Allow him to cry for 10-15 minutes in the crib before eventually holding him in your arms while he sleeps restlessly. It‚Äôs called good parenting. Not that tough.",,False,False,parenting
