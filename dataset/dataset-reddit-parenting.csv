0,My kid just texted me üå≠,"It‚Äôs code for I want to come home, but I want it to be your fault. Any random emoji when we‚Äôre not texting each other will work. He was supposed to be staying the night with a friend, so I was concerned when I get this text after I‚Äôve already gone to bed. I called him and told him ‚Äúyou were supposed to unload the dishwasher before you left, now you‚Äôve lost your privilege of spending the night. I‚Äôll be there in five minutes, have your stuff gathered up.‚Äù He got in the car and I asked what‚Äôs up. He said his friend‚Äôs grandpa was making him feel uncomfortable, but he didn‚Äôt know how to tell the friend he wanted to leave, then he thanked me for getting him out of there. We will talk more tomorrow about why he felt uncomfortable (he said it wasn‚Äôt anything bad, grandpa was just acting weird), but for tonight I will just be grateful that he remembered that I would come if he used any emoji. I don‚Äôt know if this will be helpful, or even noticed, but I wanted to put it out there in case anyone needs ideas on getting their kids out of situations when the kid feels like they can‚Äôt talk.",,False,False,parenting
1,Being the hang out house for teenagers is better than I ever imagined.,"My kids are 18 and 16 and we have somehow managed to become the house that our kids and their friends all happily gather at. I am not really sure what we did to encourage this. My wife and I are in our mid/late 50s and about as far from cool as one can get but we are willing to put up with the noise, drive friends around, and buy extra food to feed the friends. We have a rule board that says, ""This is not a frat house, so clean up your own messes. Don't do anything that has a good chance of killing you because I don't have time to bury your body. Don't do anything illegal. I won't bail you out of jail. If you like coming here, don't do anything that would make your parents stop allowing you to come over."" The kids are good about respecting the rules. When a hole was put into the wall during a game of indoor soccer, a kid came down and asked for the spackle. When a late night board game involves the loser jumping into our pool, they wash the towels they used. When a late night baking session breaks out they always clean the dishes they used. Friday was graduation for the older one and the last day of junior year for my younger one. The younger one decided to have a bunch of friends over to celebrate. When the rain forced them inside they started cooking while watching the new Jackass movie. I came out of my room late at night and all of the lights in the house we off because they were playing a version of hide and seek that included using a small flashlight to find everyone. This morning I woke up to multiple bodies fast asleep in various parts of the house and the realization that this will soon be over hit me hard. My oldest goes to college this year and my younger will will be heading out next year. I am going to miss this so much. If you have young kids or preteens, don't be afraid of being the house they want to gather at. Yes, it can get loud and as an introvert I thought I would hate this but the payoff is worth it. Last night I knew my kid was safe. I get to know what is going on with them and their friends. A few years ago when my son was at a teammates house and was being pressured to smoke, he used me as an excuse to leave and his best friend followed along. I love that even their friends see our house as a safe place to come to. That has been so valuable and so worth the noise of a bunch of teens. I'm going to miss my kids when they leave but I will also miss their friends who have made our house their second home. Edit: This has been asked a bunch so I am clarifying here. We do not allow drugs or alcohol. That falls under the don't do anything illegal rule. Despite this we are still the hang out spot. The kids don't care about that.",,False,False,parenting
2,Update on: Nobody coming to my son's birthday party,"I posted a few weeks ago that nobody had RSVP'd to my son's 6th birthday party and I was kind of at a loss. People in this sub were so kind, supportive, generous, and overall very helpful. Today was the party and I wanted to update anyone who might be interested: I took the advice of many members in the group and cancelled the original reservation at an indoor venue, then booked a pavilion at an outdoor park to help reduce covid concerns. A couple days later, a parent did RSVP and I updated him on the venue change, then mentioned he was the only RSVP I'd gotten. This saint of a man worked some magic and reached out to a few parents from their JK class, who reached out to a couple more JK parents, and suddenly I was getting RSVP's. Also at the advice of this group, I did allow my son to give out invitations to his new kindergarten class (I was hesitant because they'd only known each other for not quite 2 full weeks) and got some RSVP's from there too. The party was today, and it was fantastic.  The park had a cool playground, a nice sandy beach, and the kids had a blast playing and swimming. Usually by this time of year it's cold, rainy, and possibly snowing, but we had sunshine and 84 degrees. It was perfect. Thank you for the ideas and support, it is so appreciated.",,False,False,parenting
3,My house burned down in the middle of the night with everyone inside. Here is what I wish I knew.,"A couple days go, our house burned down. It was in the middle of the night and a complete basic freak accident. We lost everything we owned.  I've learnt so much from this experience and I really want to share what I wish I knew before it happened. Fire drills are a thing. Practice, as a family, what to do in case of a fire. Come up with exit plans and practice at night time AND day time. Keep practicing until you're sure everyone in the family is comfortable with the plan and okay to get out. Emphasis on the whole 'Get out immediately and safely, don't grab anything.' Now, as a parent you need to realize that even if you practice this over and over and that everyone knows what to do, in the eventuality of an actual fire, things might just not go as planned. To give you a blunt example, our 9 year old was woken up and when we told him 'fire, let's go' his first reaction was to hide in our room. He was in a semi awake state where he figured it was just a dream and wanted shelter. Also, I cannot state this one enough MAKE SURE YOU GO OUT WITH YOUR KIDS. I told my kids (8 and 9) to go downstairs and out the door once I was sure there was no fire there. They were waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs. They were scared. They didn't want to go outside in the middle of the night without a parent. Don't rely on your children to go outside alone. 2. Don't let your children watch the house burn down. Hell, if you can avoid it, don't watch it yourself. It's traumatic. Ask a neighbor to keep them, a grandparent to pick them up, anything. You don't want them to go through the whole set of emotions of seeing everything they own being burnt.  Afterwards, experts have suggested us not to go back to the scene with them and definitely not to go inside. At that point, do what you feel comfortable with. 3. Consult. It's a traumatic event to go through. Therapy is healthy. 4. If you have pets and they happen to be in the house, remind the firefighters over and over. Each firefighter that goes inside, tell them there is a pet. Our pets all died (2 cats and 2 parrots). It was a big fire, so firefighters didn't make it a priority to save the pets BUT they also kept telling us they didn't know there were pets in the house. 5. Take the help that people give you. Don't try and go back to normal as quickly as possible. Take the time to process what happened. 6. Fireproof safes are a thing. Right now, I can't even identify myself. All my cards, wallet, passport, certificates are burnt. That's all. At the end of the day, I feel lucky to have my family alive. It took 10 minutes for the fire to reach the roof and the walls. By then, it was all collapsing. We also are very lucky to have gotten great support from family, friends and people we know. We're so thankful and I honestly cannot wait for the day that I can give back and help others.",,False,False,parenting
4,Took my 5F daughter to Target and got the cops called on me.,"My wife's cousin is having a wedding next week at her home/backyard only family. So today I took my daughter to find a nice sweater to go with her dress.. Anyway we are in the dressing room trying out some sweaters and she sees a spider and starts screaming. Me caught off guard trying to figure it out and finally have everything under control. But I guess some ladies were concerned about a little girl screaming and a man's voice with her. As we come out there are 4 cops there waiting for us. I immediately understood what was happening and it's 1 male cope 3 women cops. I do a heavy sigh and say she saw a spider it's fine. Well it's not fine. They try to grab my daughter and stand in front of them and explained I am her father and they are not allowed to touch her. I pulled my phone out and showed them some pictures that she is my daughter and a family photo. Meanwhile my daughter keeps saying ""Papi what's wrong?"" Well the woman who was concerned just grew angry because ""WHO MAKES A LITTLE GIRL CALL A GROWN MAN PAPI"" well I am Latino and Papi is for dad not some kink shit. Well... after 40 minutes of them checking the footage of me walking in with her and such they finally believe me and let us go. I called my wife after and tell her what happened. I get picked on a bit by people with my kids and it frustrates my wife because she feels I can't do stuff like normal parenting stuff without the cops being called. Like at the grocery store I took my daughter to the bathroom and came out to security and a lady trying to ""detain me"" about my intentions with my daughter. Anyway I know there are creeps and danger out in the world and one can't be too safe but it's tiring as a Dad to constantly navigate the world in this mindset.",,False,False,parenting
5,I don't enjoy being a father *update*,"About 6-7 weeks ago I wrote a post saying ""I don't enjoy being a father, I wrote it when I was upset and didn't know what I was doing. I felt lost, suicidal and I was really at the end of my tether. Your comments and kindness and advice were greatly appreciated and I took the time to read every single one. Afterwards I said to myself, only I can change this. I looked long and hard in the mirror, what could I do to improve my relationship with my daughter, its up to me to change. So I decided no matter what my daughter did. I wouldn't get angry, I'd listen more and even though she isn't communicating fully I tried to understand her better. The first week or two were pretty much the same. Hitting and screaming the house down. But I got on her level. I spoke softly to her. I didn't ask if she wanted to go and see the moon i made her come with me, if she cried I made sure I cuddled her and spoke softly and told her about the man in the moon, the stars in the sky. I did this every night. 4 weeks ago, everything and I mean everything changed. I was going to the shops and she said ""Dadda shop"" i was shocked. I asked if she wanted to come with me, she said yes. Her mother whom she wouldn't ever leave her side was shocked as well. We went shopping together and had fun. The week after we went to the zoo just the two of us and a week after to the play centre. I firmly believe I'm no longer ""Daddy a man who just lives in her house"" I'm now ""Daddy, her best friend (her words not mine) protector and tickle machine"" her demeanor has changed so much that now when I start work in the morning, (I work from home) she has been getting on my knee crying and saying ""Daddy, no work, Daddy play"". She started in the big room in nursery and my Girlfriend said she was hysterical her first day. But it was me she was asking for. I cannot believe the difference in her behaviour with me and it makes me so happy. I've gone from dreading seeing her because I don't know what her mood is to being genuinely excited to see her so we can play and learn together. It's taken me a while but I now am the Dad I'm going to be to her and she is going to love me for it. At least until she becomes a teenager anyway.üòÇ so to all off you, your kind words and advice. I thank you. Have a great Christmas and keep your families safe.",,False,False,parenting
6,Approached by a child therapist in Walmart after 2yo was throwing a fit for Kinetic Sand,"My daughter LOVES ‚Äúmagic sand‚Äù and we were specifically at Walmart for that. She earned a little prize. But, she wanted to open the package and play with it right then and there, and I‚Äôve been trying to teach her that we have to pay for things before we open them. She doesn‚Äôt understand that concept yet. So of course, she started screaming and throwing a fit from the toy section all the way to self check out which had somewhat of a line. The whole time I was telling her in a calm voice ‚Äúbaby, we can open it in the car‚Äù ‚Äúwe have to pay for it first, then we can open it‚Äù she kept crying ‚Äúplease mom can you please open it for me‚Äù and I kept saying ‚Äúno baby I‚Äôm sorry but those are the rules‚Äù and she would continue to scream and cry. I wasn‚Äôt too concerned about other people because I didn‚Äôt care. It didn‚Äôt seem like there were any Karens around and no one was staring so I figured I was okay. Every time someone finished their transaction, the light above the register would turn green, so I started trying to distract my daughter by saying ‚Äúoh look! That light just turned green, I wonder which one will turn green next, do you know? Let‚Äôs watch and see!‚Äù And it actually worked! She was still whimpering, but she turned around and started looking out for which one would turn green. It was finally our turn and as soon as we scanned it (let her scan it herself) I opened the package and gave her some sand. She stopped crying immediately and was so happy! As I was opening the sand, the lady who was in front of us came up to me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you this because no one else will. I‚Äôm a child therapist and what you did‚Ä¶ you did everything right. From talking to her calmly, explaining the rules, trying to distract her, everything you did was spot on, you‚Äôre doing a great job.‚Äù It really meant a lot to me because gentle parenting IS NOT EASY! It would‚Äôve been easy to yell at her, take her to the car, and spank her/scold her for ‚Äúbeing disruptive‚Äù. But mama don‚Äôt play that shit! I get shit from my bf‚Äôs family for not hitting her when she acts up and it‚Äôs tiring trying to explain that‚Äôs not healthy. My FIL once told me ‚Äúit WILL hurt you more than it‚Äôll ever hurt them. Just give her a pop in the mouth and watch how fast she shuts up‚Äù and at that time she was barely 1.

7,"Forced ""Date Night"" yesterday","Hectic life my wife and I have. She works midnights and hi work days. My girls and I usually go 3 days without seeing her. It totally sucks but it pays the bills. I was getting dinner ready to throw in the crock pot while we cleaned the house. Had no plans because it was snowing. Girls in and out of the house playing in the snow and mailing messes in between. My girls (8 and 10) were scheming while we were cleaning. They made 2 sandwiches and didn't eat them. Just put them on paper played in the fridge. Odd. We're trying to clean up around them trying not to get upset while they are making more messes. Ripped paper and snacks everywhere. Somehow they got us upstairs, blindfolded and separated. They each picked out clothes for us to wear. Nice clothes. We changed and they staged an afternoon ""Date Night."" Brought us together in the living room where my wife was wearing a beautiful dress and I had a suit and tie on. Kids sat us down and put on a Netflix movie and we enjoyed the rest of the afternoon watching ""The Kissing Booth"" trilogy and ordering sandwiches and snacks from their snack bar as they waited on us. It was a much needed evening for all of us. Clean up starts today.",,False,False,parenting

It's a lonely existence and being a stay at home means I don't get tons of socialization anyway. Yesterday my wife (who normally works) had the day off and went with me to the play space.

9,I don‚Äôt get why everyone thinks it‚Äôs so hard to put an infant to sleep.,"Maybe I‚Äôm just a natural parent, but it‚Äôs pretty straightforward. Just put him in the crib in a full swaddle with his pacifier. When he starts to cry, remove one arm from the swaddle. Now, he‚Äôll use that arm to knock out the pacifier. Put the pacifier back in, but make sure he doesn‚Äôt see you or he will wake up (alternatively, make sure he sees you so he knows you are there). Repeat this step 2-3 times. At this stage, he will be overtired and begin screaming. Remove him from the crib and swaddle, wait 10-15 minutes, then put him back in the swaddle (alternatively, don‚Äôt do this as it will make it worse).  Find his pacifier, which he has violently thrown across the room. Insert pacifier by delicately navigating his thrashing arms. Allow him to cry for 10-15 minutes in the crib before eventually holding him in your arms while he sleeps restlessly. It‚Äôs called good parenting. Not that tough.",,False,False,parenting

13,My wife saved a little girl,"If this isn't the right place to post this kind of thing please feel free to delete it. I just want to brag about my wife because I'm absolutely swooning. A couple days ago we were putting our daughter down for a nap just like any other day. Our daughter's room faces the street for reference. We were about to leave the room when we heard what we thought was a cat meowing loudly or kids playing outside. I heard the same noise again and thought that it vaguely sounded like ""HELP"". I took a peak out of the blinds and saw our neighbor holding her 2-3 year old daughter, screaming at the top of her lungs for help, and that her daughter was choking. I haven't really experienced, for lack of a better term, ""primal parent mode"" before. I just started repeating over and over ""there's a baby choking, there's a baby choking"". Queue huge adrenaline dump for the both of us as we rushed for the front door. I've never seen my wife jump into action the way that she did to assist a mother that we had never met. She was out the door and across the street before I could even get outside. The screams of that poor mother are haunting. Her little girl was limp and practically foaming at the mouth. Within just a couple seconds my wife had the blockage cleared and a few seconds later I heard the little girl cry. She was breathing again. I just wanted to cry from the pure emotion of the moment. EMS showed up a couple minutes later and proceeded to check the little girl out to make sure she didn't have to be transported. Everything turned out to be ok. I'd hate to think what would've happened if my wife hadn't been there to help in those short couple of minutes. I know that I'm still riding a high from watching her save that little girl but she is a superhero to me. Not only did she immediately spring into action, save that baby, but with this little girl still in her arms she turned some of her attention to the mother trying to calm her down as well. Look out for the people around you. We've never thought about ourselves as super knowledgeable parents and frankly half the time I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. But you never know, something that seems simple may not be so simple to someone else. EDIT: There have been several people asking what she did/what they should do in a situation like this. I admittedly need to re-up on a cpr/life saver course and would hate to tell you the wrong thing. She used a mix of back blows and what appeared to be a heimlich variation. There's a large portion of this thread dedicated to the discussion on the efficacy of the Heimlich and other techniques. What she used may or may not have been the currently accepted technique/procedure for this situation. All I know is that it worked in this specific situation and I'm thankful that it did. This thread has really made it clear to me the importance of taking a class so you'll know what to do in the event that it happens to you or a loved one. I know I'm definitely signing up for one soon. We both appreciate all the kind words of affirmation.",,False,False,parenting
14,The absolutely worst thing about having children isn‚Äôt what I thought it would be.,"It‚Äôs that they grow up. That, to me, is the suckiest, shittiest, most horrendous thing about having children. I carved pumpkins today, and I would give anything to have my adult children back as little kids, getting excited about making their costumes and watching ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown‚Äù and going trick-or-treating and then fighting over the candy they got. I used to hate it when older parents would say to me, ‚ÄúOh, enjoy it now, they grow up so fast!‚Äù and I would be like, ‚ÄúWhatever lady, come and do my job for a day and I bet you will be begging the Gods for instant metamorphosis into adulthood.‚Äù  But, sadly, all those parents were right. I can‚Äôt even think about it too hard because I get the lump in my throat. I wish I would have enjoyed them more. Edit: Thank you SO MUCH for all of your comments and words of encouragement.

16,Daughter came out to us as gay and is resentful that we are supportive. Wtf?,"This is more of a rant than anything else, I guess.  Our daughter (16) came out to us earlier this year.  Her mother and I have always been very open with our daughter that we believe everyone is free to love and/or be attracted to whomever they want.  We have always made sure to convey to our children that a person's sexual orientation makes no difference to us.  People are people. Well, one day our daughter called us into the living room, sat us down, and explained to us that she was gay and she had a girlfriend.  She wanted us to know that this didn't change anything about her, she was still the same person, and she didn't want us to see her differently.  Our reaction to this was along the lines of ""Oh, that's cool!  Is (girlfriend's name) your girlfriend? We thought that was why you two had been hanging out so much.  You should ask her if she wants to come over for the family thing on Saturday.""  She just kind of stared at us like the conversation hadn't gone her way or something. This was apparently not the response she was looking for.  She apparently was expecting some level of shock or pushback.  Some sort of ""don't tell your grandmother, she will be so heartbroken because of the decisions you have chosen to make!"". She has recently informed us that she feels like we care less about than she thought we did because we didn't care that she wasn't heterosexual.  She is under the impression that parents are supposed to have some sort of over-the-top reaction during their child's coming-out announcement and that if they don't, they are depriving said child of an experience or rite of passage or something. So her mother and I are just continuing to be supportive while we wait for our daughter's grumpiness to blow over (hopefully).  If supportiveness and time doesn't fix it then we will have to reassess at a later date I guess.  Teenagers, man. I can't even.",,False,False,parenting

18,I banned all vegetables from my house and it's been a game-changer,"Sorry for the click-baity title, but we've been having so much fun with this game in my house and I wanted to share, in case it helps anyone else. It started when I was telling my four year old that she's growing up way too fast, and I need her to just slow down for a minute. She told me she is growing because she's eating her vegetables, so I replied ""That's it! No more vegetables in this house!!¬† No more broccoli, no more peas! I'm getting rid of alllll these bell peppers!"" Obviously I didn't actually throw away all the veggies in the house, but my kids thought this was hilarious and we continued the game. At Thanksgiving: ""Oh, mom, don't serve her any of those green beans, she's not allowed to have vegetables."" At dinner one night: ""Wait a minute, wait a minute... are you telling me that peas are a VEGETABLE?! I thought they were little green candies! Give me back those peas!"" My kids are pretty standard picky eaters- some days they're into peas and sweet potatoes, some days not. They're not big on trying new things, but they LOVE this game! They'll gleefully gobble up their peas in front of me while I groan about how they're gonna GROW now, and beg for a serving of green beans until I finally relent and serve them ""just a little bit"". I saw a post on here recently about reverse psychology, and I too am amazed by how well this works. I made very sure that they understand that we're just playing a game and vegetables are actually good, but my kids are having so much fun with it, I see us continuing to play for a long time.",,False,False,parenting

20,I gave up on modern parenting and advised my Daughter to beat the crap out of her bully.,"I'm not proud it had to come to this,  but last week we counseled my 3rd grader to fight back.  My brother taught her to grab someone by the hair and start punching. I told her to go for a nice slap, it will be more effective.  Especially considering my daughter is a very nice kid,  usually looking out for the underdog.  She ain't got no fighting skills but anyone can give a good slap. Kids have bullied her all school year,  but mostly this one Jerk. The school calls me all the time,  ""there was an incident at school today where Jerk /pushed/tripped/slapped/punched/yanked hair of Daughter but she didn't really get hurt, we're just letting you know."" Even more often,  Daughter comes home and tells me herself about what he did. I've brought it up to the teacher and the principal and they just say they take bullying seriously but haven't seen it happen to Daughter (despite being the ones to call me?. We've tried the make nice, ignore, avoid,  but there are no consequences for Jerk. Let him get hit by a girl,  kill a little bit of that machismo culture. Edit: being a parent is way different than how I thought I'd be.  Never in my life could I have predicted that I'd give up mediation and go to physical self-defense. I'd like to clarify, this is only if he hurts her again. She cries every morning and night about not wanting to go to school because of bullies and the teachers that don't care. Attacking people is wrong Small update: Regarding changing schools, all of the ones nearby are D rated schools.  She already goes to a school out of district that my mom drives her 20 minutes everyday.  I'd love to leave this school behind though, everything about it is lacking.In an ideal world I'd enroll her in a self defense class but the closest one would be a 40 minute bus ride away and conflicts with my college classes. Simply giving her permission to defend herself has given her confidence.  Yesterday she stood up to kids bullying a kindergartenener and kicked one of them. Still hasn't taught Jerk a lesson but I hold out hope.",,False,False,parenting

22,[UPDATE] Should I report a bus driver who keeps stopping specifically to talk to my 6-year,"A while ago I posted on this sub for advice about a bus driver whose behavior towards my child had started to ring some alarm bells. He was stopping his bus and talking only to my kid, not acknowledging the adults at the stop, and jokingly inviting him to ride his bus instead of his school route. I was torn, because while I was 99% sure it must be innocent, and I really didn't want to get the dude into trouble, it had started feeling weird, and I worried about the potential consequences if I was wrong. The original post is here: It didn't get a huge amount of traction, but I wanted to post an update because there was quite a diversity of opinions there, and I think the story had a basically happy ending in which sanity prevailed. I ended up speaking to my child's school, who basically said ""that sounds concerning"" and kicked the ball back to me. I then sat on it for a while, during which we had a couple more incidents where the driver stopped and again joked about my kid getting on his bus to go to McDonald's. I did a bit of research and found a way I could submit an online feedback form that would trigger a call back from the local depot manager without me having to give details up-front that might automatically trigger disciplinary action for the driver. The manager was awesome. She heard my concerns, said that as a fellow parent she totally got it, and asked for time to investigate, and promised there would be no repercussions for the driver at this stage. Turns out that that particular bus company mandates that all their routes do a timing stop at our stop. So the stopping itself was innocent! That alone took a huge weight off my mind. She said this driver is known for being ""quirky"" and that having a joke with customers is very much on brand. I was happy to leave it then. But she also said she'd run the cctv footage and confirmed him inviting my kid onto his bus with the promise of McDonald's, and that she didn't consider that appropriate behavior for their drivers. She asked my permission to talk to him, since she thought he needed to be made aware of how this might look, but reassured me that this would not result in any kind of black mark against him. As far as I know that has now been done. I guess overall this is a good outcome. I feel bad for the driver, and I'm not gonna lie, seeing him next time is going to be super awkward. But things are now on record in some way, no one got hurt, no one lost their job, and (I think) I made the right decision as a parent. EDIT: Thanks everyone for the comments, upvotes and kind words. I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it has. It's reassuring to know that most people think this was handled well. I did stress about it, and struggled to find the balance between assuming the best and acknowledging the possibility of the worst. So thank you :-).",,False,False,parenting

Today I got new insurance information and the forms explained he is only eligible to be on my insurance until 2033.... 2033... 2033, when he will turn 18. When he will graduate from high school. When I will not be legally responsible for supporting him. That's it. 2033 will be years past him wanting Dad cuddles, let alone Daddy cuddles. It's already going by way too fast. That is what sucks as a parent. These little things that entered the world as a stranger that fit so easily in your hands will grow up.

27,For her,"At my daughters yearly check up during the pandemic last October, her doctor mentioned her weight. He said she was in the 98 percentile and her bmi was dangerously high. After almost a year of online school and staying indoors I knew she was less active but had no idea it was affecting her health so drastically. He gave some typical advice about diet and asked how I wanted to proceed, mentioning that it is a sensitive topic for some parents and he understands if I just want to check up on it in a year. Alternatively, he said we could do more follow ups to address the issue. We opted to do more follow ups. Since then we have done monthly (virtual) visits with her doctor. We started with a small goal: no more sugary drinks. We were never huge on soda, but did buy capri suns, koolaids, and plenty of apple juice. After that we made more changes, we stopped eating frozen prepared meals and take out. We followed the 5-2-1-0 rule and stuck to it. Overall, the small changes weren't that hard or even noticeable to the kids. We didn't weigh in or push to my daughter that we were losing weight, just that we trying to be more healthy and she was very receptive. Our last goal was to start doing morning runs, and as much as I dreaded the early morning excercise, we did it! 4 times a week, 30 minute runs. It has been hard, my legs were sore and I have missed out on a lot of sleep. Yesterday we had the first in person visit with her doctor and he said she has a healthy bmi and is now in the 80th percentile for weight! He encouraged us to keep on going and I know we will. The diet changes were not hard but adding the extra exercise was (for me, mostly). Now I am looking forward to our runs, the whole family is healthier and I feel closer to my daughter than ever. We just got back from a run and I am exhausted, but getting the high five and her telling me ""man, our stamina is getting so great now"" feels amazing.

I have heard a lot of soon to be parents and new parents talk about things they promised they would never do- and then inevitably end up doing anyway (eg: ""I will never yell at my kid"" or ""I will never use my shirt to wipe their boogers""). 14 years ago at my baby shower, someone asked me what I was ""never"" going to do, and I wasn't sure how I would parent then, but the one promise I made myself, and my son, was that I would never answer their questions with authoritarian answers like ""because I said so"" or ""because I'm the parent and you're the kid"". I absolutely hated it as a kid myself, and didn't understand how that could possibly be a good way to parent. Anyway, fast forward to a couple weeks ago. My 13 year old and I were chatting one morning, and he brought up that he was watching some YouTube shorts where people talked about ""relatable"" things, and he heard one that was about having parents that say ""because I said so"" or similar. He said he stopped for a moment, and realized he could not relate to this at all. ""Anyway, mom, thanks for not being that parent, it's really nice, and I'm super glad I can't relate to this."" ...

Well, I was in his room grabbing the bags of clothes he put aside that he outgrew or no longer wanted for donation and I looked over at this desk and saw a condom partially out. So naturally being a parent I opened his desk and saw this Trojan condom and he had his laptop open and he was typing a letter -as an FYI - my son's grandfather and uncle are a**holes and were really demeaning to his mom and he has/had an issue being able to gather his thoughts to speak up for himself especially if he is nervous so he tends to type it out read it to himself and practice until he is comfortable to speak to us about it. He has gotten better so seeing this letter made me smile but also I found it to be a bit funny. Dad, I went to CVS 9 times to buy condoms. Each time I went in I was nervous and nauseous. There are so many options how do you know which one is best? Do people have that much sex that they try all of them? This last time I ran in grabbed a box and just went straight to the counter and I thought I was going to pass out when the lady just looked at me and asked ""is that it?""

He is NOT ready for sex or is having sex I am pretty sure this was curiosity - I will find out later after talking to him. If he would have brought it up to me I would have gone and purchased condoms for him and had a whole discussion, this is out of character for him so I am proud that he pushed himself to figure out his experience in something so small yet so large.

39,Parenting tip: You have no clue what is happening in your child's life,"In response to a request from me, my oldest child (m,28) sent me an email summarizing the childhood experiences he had to struggle through (and still struggling through). Four words:   I had no idea. Quick advice to my younger self: If you see perplexing behavior, just assume your child is working through something really hard.   They are not trying to disobey or disappoint you.  They are genuinely wrestling powerful drives to learn, to fit in, to explore, and to find acceptance. Assume your child will never talk about their shame, especially if you pry.   Instead, regularly and openly teach the concepts that will negate the false ideas behind shame. Take a couple of days with your partner and try your best to remember every source of shame in your life, then ask yourself the hard questions for how you might be perpetuating it with your children.   Make a plan to reject the stupid ideas and traditions behind the shame and invent your own sensible, authentic traditions. Create regular opportunities for non-stressful interactions with your children.   Have 1:1s with your kids, but make sure 90% or more are not about teaching or problems, but rather about enjoyment, creativity, play, or just hanging out.",,False,False,parenting

My father is a doctor, a very well known one actually, a top senior executive and also the head of the board of directors at the biggest hospital in the country. So you can imagine how busy he is all the time with doctors  following him with papers and patients families always around him. Today is the blood donation day, so I went to the hospital to donate blood, with a mask on sitting on the bench inside the hospital waiting for my turn, a common scenario but I rarely visit the hospital, no one knows me, minding my own business, and suddenly from a far I saw my father, looking at me, he realised its me!! with all his people around him, giving me a very big smile, he started walking towards me, not caring in a way I felt it to anyone around him. The love in his eyes I felt coming towards me hit me that exact moment, its the same love that I hold for my daughter, a weird wonderful emotional feeling. He came and stood next to me while I was sitting, chit chatted for a bit as I could feel his excitement for seeing and realizing his own son by random. After he left I imagined myself in his shoes, 29 years in the future, I see my daughter, the one that's 2 months old now, by random sitting on a bench in the far distance, I would do the same, the emotions would be the same and the love would be immeasurable.",,False,False,parenting
42,I was robbed at gunpoint with my toddler and I made lifechanging decisions,"I was arriving at my building's garage, driving on a saturday, end of the afternoon. My son was at the back of my car, just the two of us. Before making the block's turn, I noticed two strange motorcycles. I knew I was a target and there was nothing I could do. Need to say I DON'T live in US, I live in Brazil in a large famous city, in a normal, not fancy, neighborhood. Here, we drive with this fear. Of being robbed, of being kidnapped. I always drove with my son in the carseat, because the risk of accidents are more likely than robbery. Other moms I know don't drive (only use driving apps, taxis) to go around with their kids/babies and even sit at the back if dad is driving. It is so sad we have to live like this - balancing which risk is more likely, being robbed with your kid taken with the car, or suffering an accident. The horror. Anyway, I don't even know HOW but I stayed calm, put the car at park, opened the window and told the robber - I HAVE a KID IN THE BACK. He said, GET THE KID. I jumped from within the car to the back, unbuckled my clueless little boy, and got off (was dragged off) the car with him in my arms. Let all my belongings inside. Entered the building. They took off with my car. I now cannot drive, I shake anytime a motorcycle passes by, I never leave home after dark. Specially on weekends. I am talking to a specialist twice a week. I took time off from work and slowly started to go back to my activities. And I decided to MOVE with my family to another city, in a State that has better safety indexes. My job is not 100% safe, if they don't allow me to stay fully online as it has been since pandemic started march 2020 (I work for a very famous multinational company so I have hope their policy will allow).  And this will imply in a big change for my son as well, new school, new home at a new city, etc. I worry more with him, having to start a life / make friends, even though he will be only 4 yo at the time we move. But we will be closer to family that live in this other state. We will sell this brand refurbished apartment that was our dream and investment made this year. But opens up the opportunity to live in a safer, lower cost, smaller city with the best University in country - where me and my husband studied and met. I trust it is the right choice at this time. This is just some venting I needed to do, thanks for reading and if you have words for me they are welcome.  EDIT: I am SO THANKFULL for all the messages received, starting my day after posting last night, reading ALL of them is so heart warming. I feel the energy. The positivity.

44,My baby has blood in urine,"You are 11 days old today, and yesterday on July 4th we found blood in your urine. We knew this was a red flag and took you immediately to urgent care, who said he has a fever and needs to go to the ER. We took you to the ER and they admitted you. They tried to get a IV going and poked each hand, arms, and legs and could never get a IV to stick, they took mercy on you and just gave you a shot of anti-biotics. That night I just watched you, snuggled with you and tried to tell you it would be okay. The next morning you decided to dramatically cut down on your feeding, so much that we had to insert a feeding tube. They decided you are too high risk and needed to be transferred by ambulance to another hospital. But first they absolutely needed to get a IV going and they finally got one right on his forehead. As they loaded you into ambulance my heart has never felt so much pain. This is not fair to him. I deserve this more than him. We arrived at the next hospital. But everyone is still confused as to what is causing the problem. Test after test and we are finally getting somewhere. Blood Clots, my heart sank. I have never felt so scared in my life. The doctor straight told me there is a chance it goes to the lungs and that would be very bad, but we can treat it, but we still need to do tests, ct scan, blood tests to determine the cause. So now I'm here, not knowing the future of my baby, so hold your little ones tight. Update: Thanks for all the love, this has been the hardest thing we've ever been through emotionally and it really helps to read the comments. His latest CT Scan showed he had no bleeding in his brain(finally some good news) and everything was fine there, so they got the green light to start blood thinners. We will be in talks with doctors all day tommrow. We are at least starting to uncover this mystery. The good news is all his major organs are functioning fine. He still has a fever so that is a totally separate issue they are working at the same time. I guess blood clots don't cause fevers.",,False,False,parenting
45,Jesus christ is the bar set low for fathers.,"In August my wife and I got our little son. He's an absolute miracle that develops ridicilously fast and has the strength of an ox, but sadly one of his kidneys has developed a mutation that has given him a disposition to get urinary tract infection. My wife and I both got him while still finishing up our studies, her in medicine, me as a teacher. We decided she took a break from the studies, as she really needed it mentally, and since my classes were mostly online. That means we are both around a lot, but holy shit is it just ridicilous how disproportionate the reaction to this has been. Doctors, nurses you name it never hesitates to clap in their hands how ""involved"" I am as a father. The amazement I was met with because I knew the temperature of my own son at a check-up was just completely ridicilous. My wife is here doing at least 60% of the work, since I still need time to study, and she's doing an amazing job at it. But no, let's all marvel at the father who's participating in basic parent duty.

46,I spoke to daycare about my three year old not liking it there and now she does!,"My three year old has been saying that she doesn‚Äôt like daycare and that she doesn‚Äôt want to go since January when she moved from the toddler room to preschool. I put it down to being one of the youngest rather than one of the oldest and a little loss of confidence due to the pandemic. But it was beginning to get to me. She seemed to have a good day when she was there and came out smiling, went in willingly etc. But she regularly says she doesn‚Äôt want to go when we talk about our plans for the week. Yesterday on the way she told me she didn‚Äôt like daycare. She‚Äôs three, so although I tried to ask her why, we didn‚Äôt really get any answers. Eventually she said she didn‚Äôt like the people, but wouldn‚Äôt say which people (kids or staff). When we got there I spoke to her key worker, who assured me that she seems happy, but sometimes she wants to play on her own and gets fed up with the other kids. This makes sense because my kid loves play dates, but after a couple of hours will ask to go home. The key worker suggested that if kiddo wants ‚Äúchill time‚Äù she should find her and she‚Äôll take her to the ‚Äúcalm down area‚Äù. It‚Äôs been two days and my kid is so much happier. She goes to an adult, asks for time out, gets to chose a toy, book or pencils and stays in the calm down area for 5-10 minutes and then comes out when she‚Äôs ready. She only does it once a day. She‚Äôs much happier going now. Moral of the story: talking to daycare staff about your concerns works!",,False,False,parenting

You're absolutely right. Just because it's easy for me doesn't mean it's easy for you. How about next time, I teach you how to do it?"" He was happy and satisfied with that response and went back to playing. It stuck with me though. He gave me an important reminder that I'm a 30 year old adult and he's just a small child.

One day they have a best friend, and then the next they‚Äôve been ghosted. Some kids can handle this ok, and that‚Äôs awesome! But for a lot of teens, the sudden absence can be really confusing. When we were younger, we had the benefit of parents/siblings answering the phone and saying, ‚ÄúSo-and-so is grounded.‚Äù Kids nowadays don‚Äôt get that. As an adult, it‚Äôd be pretty stressful if a best friend I talked to everyday, throughout the day ghosted me. Throw some teenage hormones into the mix and I‚Äôd be a little ball of anxiety and depression, two things teens are already prone to. Do we have to be considerate of other parents‚Äô kids? No. Would we want to see our own kids spend a week thinking their best friend hated them? Also no. Edit: thanks for the support and awards!

With all of the garbage that is out in the world these days, my wife and I have tried to keep them somewhat innocent and away from things like social media.  We just don't think that a 13 and 10 year old should have unrestricted access to the internet and social media. Well yesterday my oldest came home from school and showed us what one of her so called friends had emailed her earlier that day.  This boy is 14 years old and accused my daughter of being gay or at least bi and when she said that she isn't he said ""prove it by letting me f**k you"", obviously using the aforementioned accusation as a way to proposition her.  She replied by saying ""don't speak to me like that"" and then he replied ""you know you want this d**k"". Even though it was longer ago than I'd like to admit, I remember being a 14yr old idiot boy.  But there's no way in hell I would have ever thought to speak like that to a girl. To top it off, this is a kid that we took in to our home when he was having issues at home. I'm just so pissed and upset for my daughter.

She did not bother to go the bathroom, which is right next to the room she was sleeping in. Instead of telling anyone, even my daughter so we could help her, she laid down back on the bed, in the vomit and went back to sleep. The mother was not shocked by this behavior and said she just throws up alot. We didn't let her stay again until a month later.  I gave the kid the benefit of the doubt and probably shouldn't have. She stayed again, left her school uniform on the kids bathroom floor, underwear and pants covered with feces. She smeared feces on my daughter's bedroom wall, my bathroom and it was all over the bed. She put a blanket over the bed so no one would see, she says. The mother once again did not act surprised and told me they don't have any clean laundry because she does this at home.

55,These bad mother's day stories are killing me. Here's my tips for making yours a success,"I know it's a little late in the game but these post about fathers f****** up Mother's Day are killing me. Here's what I make sure to do every year to ensure my wife feel special on her day. Sleep in. Let your wife sleep in as long as she can on Mother's Day. This is important! Breakfast in bed. Even if your wife isn't a big breakfast eater like mine I still had a small bowl of fruit and boba tea chai that the kids helped me make. Make sure to include a little flower on the tray! Mimosa. If your wife drinks this is a nice little treat, especially popping a bottle of champagne after she's up. It's class. Mother's Day gift. I always have the kids make a little craft beforehand to give us a Mother's Day present. This year was they painted 12in by 12in piece of plywood and the kids drew flowerpots and did hand print flowers and petals above them. Excursions. You got to go do something.  today we're going to hit a winery, I'll give my kids ten bucks to pop into an antique store on the way up and buy something for Mom, and then get dressed up and take them all to a historical Village near us to take some photos. Even if you're on a budget you can always get the kids dressed up nice and take your cell phone out to a pretty location to take photos of them and mom. Later we'll do game night and spa treatments and my wife can take a nice quiet bath with candles and a glass of wine after the kids are in bed. Before that the kids and I will be cooking up some pork chops and mashed potatoes. Some of these things cost money and I know people are on a budget but a lot of them are pretty simple [make breakfast/dinner, sleep in, photos etc.] and with a little foresight it doesn't take too much to make a nice Mother's Day for your partner. It's often a hard, thankless, unpaid job and taking some time to appreciate it is very important. Side note: if you're one of these dads who says ""she's not my mother it's up to the kids to plan something!"" you're fucking up big time mate and I'd highly encourage you to re-evaluate your priorities.",,False,False,parenting

I made my almost 3 year old lunch for school, packed his bag, packed a bag of wipes and pull ups because his teacher asked for them. I got him up, got him changed and dressed, teeth brushed, ready to go. Made our vitamin waters, made him breakfast for the car, got the car packed, got him in the car and left by 7:15. Drove him to school, dropped him off. Drove myself to work, worked all day at my insane crazy job in fundraising for a local food bank. Left work at 4:30, picked up our son from school, drove into town to pick up dinner and then to a gas station because my son and I had both run out of water. Both times I stopped I got my son out of the car in the sleet rain because March on the east coast. Finally I got home. My husband, whose work ended at 3:30, had already been home for awhile. He has weekly teletherapy calls on Wednesdays at 5 so I do the pickups on Wednesdays so I can stay at work until whenever I want. Anyway, I‚Äôm home. I make dinner for my very hungry kid, and I indicate to my husband that I‚Äôm very tired, it‚Äôs been a long day and that our son needs a bath. He asks if I want him to give him a bath (because I OWN that, I own that decision - if he didn‚Äôt say anything, it would be assumed that either I would be giving that bath like I normally do OR that I would be directing him to give him that bath). I said yes. My husband says, ‚Äúok, will you do bedtime?‚Äù I say yes even though I‚Äôm disappointed he can‚Äôt see how utterly exhausted I am.

I scoop myself some Indian food into a bowl from what I brought home and sit and eat dinner, my husband gets his own bowl and does the same. In the middle of dinner, I get up and begin drawing a bath. Because I apparently OWN the water temperature and/or the task of creating this space for our son. It fills appropriately, I turn off the water. I get him down from the table (our table is too high, we need a new family friendly one but Jesus it‚Äôs expensive) and told my husband I was going to recharge. Bath is going on for not even ten minutes and my husband yells from the bathroom ‚Äúhoney can you get me set up with towels?‚Äù At this point I‚Äôm dismayed. I had just begun to recharge my battery - it wasn‚Äôt fucking recharged yet - and I now have to manage yet another piece of day for my family. Know who gets the towels and Jammie‚Äôs set up 80% of the time when I give a bath? Fucking ME. I walk the ten feet from the bathroom to the bedroom, grab the towel, lay it on the fucking bed, and bring the other one to the bathroom while my son plays happily for 45 seconds. Know who gives 90% of baths while my husband does whatever he wants for a solid hour? Fucking ME. But it‚Äôs a small request, right? So sure. I grab Jammie‚Äôs and a diaper, two towels, set one on the bed and bring the other one to my husband. My husband says ‚Äútablet?‚Äù As a way of reminding me to also grab that. And I can‚Äôt find it. It takes me probably five minutes to find the find the thing and now I‚Äôm pissed. Now I‚Äôm done. My husband doesn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm mad, we get into an argument where he just keeps saying ‚Äúit was a simple request‚Äù and I don‚Äôt know how to tell him that it‚Äôs not the fact that he asked me for something as much as it is the fact that for the entire day, he hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúowned‚Äù anything. He‚Äôs just helped. I own everything. If I‚Äôm not doing something 100% already, then I‚Äôm making core decisions about it or helping to create, manage or maintain it. And when I ask for time for myself it gets punctured by what I can only gather is a complete inability to read a fucking room. Anybody else feel me out there? Edit: Just want to say THANK YOU for the outpouring of support and advice, wow. I ordered Fair Play cards and after working a 12 hour day yesterday (during which my husband picked up our son, took him to the park, fed him dinner and put him to bed and they had a blast) I‚Äôll have a talk with him today about all this. I will also catch up on comments I wasn‚Äôt able to read yet. I need to stop wishing my husband were more intuitive and just tell him what I need. I need to let go of perfection and let him do things his own way. And he needs to help out more with the kids. Just also want to add that I actually enjoy making breakfast and lunch for him to go. It‚Äôs cheaper, it takes me like fifteen minutes tops and I have to make it for my son anyways so‚Ä¶.otherwise I‚Äôd be lying in bed, awake, dicking around on my phone.

60,Furious With My Daughter's New Teacher!!,"Update here! My daughter, 5 years old, has just started Year 1 at school and she's having issues with her teacher, and now so am I. I received a call from the school office at around 11:15am saying that my daughter had weed herself whilst in class and was asked to bring her some clean clothes. Of course, I did and when I got there my daughter was upset. Which is understandable, it's an embarrassing thing to have happen. I gave her a hug, told her that it was okay, and then helped her clean up and get into her clean uniform in the toilets. She was still very upset. I reminded her that if she needed to go to the toilet that she should put her hand up and ask, which she knows. My daughter is usually really good with going to the toilet. She knows when she has to go and will ask or take herself depending on the situation. I can count on one hand the number of times that she's had an accident since starting school (nursery even), and all of those times were because there wasn't a toilet available. She hasn't once had an accident at school before. It was after telling her this that she told me she had asked to go several times!! She said that she had asked to go three times and each time her teacher had said no, and told her to wait until lunchtime like a big girl. He also told her that if she went to the toilet during his lesson then he would take however long it took her to go out of her lunchtime! He was effectively giving my five year old daughter detention. Obviously, she doesn't want to miss out on her lunchtime with her friends so she didn't go and ended up having an accident. I am so mad! I didn't even think they could give out ""detention""-like punishments that young, nor refuse to let a child go to the toilet? She's five for godsake! She was still really upset by the time we got her cleaned up, and I was raging, so I took her home with me instead of sending her back to class. They weren't happy about it, but at the end of the day my child didn't want to go back into her class because she was embarrassed and upset through no fault of her own, and they wouldn't let me speak to her teacher because he was still in class. That's probably a good thing because I would have ripped into him. I have an older daughter a couple years above so had to pick her up at the end of the school day. I took this opportunity to catch my five year old's teacher whilst I was there as they're let out ten minutes earlier than my oldest daughter. I asked him about what happened today and he said that she'd had an accident, as if I didn't already know. He didn't once mention that she had asked to go to the toilet, or what he had threatened her with! So I mentioned it, and he said to me that it was his policy that the kids aren't allowed to go to the toilet during his lesson unless it was an emergency or they had health issues. To which I told him, it was very obviously an emergency. Then, I said very clearly to my daughter in front of him that if she needed to go to the toilet again and her teacher says no after she asks politely, then she should take herself to the toilet and not worry about the consequences, and that I will sort it. Her teacher was not happy at that and told me that in his classroom she had to follow his rules, to which I very curtly told him that he doesn't get to deny my child the right to go to the toilet and reminded him that she is five years old. She can't wait until lunchtime, especially when it's nearly an hour away. He then told me that if she goes to the toilet during his lesson that she will have the minutes taken off her lunchtime or playtime (they get a morning playtime, lunchtime and an afternoon playtime). I then told him that I don't give him permission to do that to my child and if I find out he has, I won't be happy and will take things further. I've scheduled a meeting with the new headteacher for Monday morning because I'm not happy with how he's treating my daughter. This isn't the first issue I've had with him as her new teacher and this is only the second week back at school! A total of eight days! The second day back she took her cardigan off because she was really warm and he shouted at her for doing so! Apparently another one of his rules is that you have to ask permission to take your sweatshirt/cardigan off in his classroom? He made her put it back on, and when she asked him to take it off like she was told to, he said no! What in God's name? This isn't a school rule and my oldest daughter has never had to ask permission to take her cardigan off before. My daughter very much loves going to school but has since said she doesn't want to go back because (I'm assuming) she's very embarrassed about wetting herself. She's also said she doesn't like her new teacher and doesn't want to be in his class. This breaks my heart because she was so excited to go back to school because this was ""big school"" for her... It's the beginning of Key Stage 1 and the start of her education and now she's practically scared to!",,False,False,parenting
61,Have scientists studied the pacifier? It defies physics.,"These things seem to bend the fabric of space and time. We must, as a species, learn this power. After two children, I have the following observations that I believe should be investigated: Regardless of its surroundings, if you drop a pacifier anywhere around a dresser, bed, couch, table, chair, etc, it will bounce and shoot directly underneath this legged furniture. Never out in the open. Perhaps local gravitational fields are having an affect here. Pacifiers actually absorb energy while falling. How do I know this? They will often travel much further horizontally than the height dropped vertically. It is not uncommon for my baby to let one fall out of her mouth, only for it to miraculously shoot across the room (under a couch, of course, see previous point). They seem to slip between dimensions. Between two kids and a couple of years, I have bought probably 14 pacifiers. I now count 3. Extensive searches have been done, and thorough cleanings of both house and vehicles have resulted in this conclusion. There are now simply 3 left in the universe. Nothing else in this world can vanish. I think, for the betterment of humanity, that we should divert vast resources to these phenomenal items. They are truly magical, or demonic.

68,Happy birthday Kiely,"Kiely Nevaeh Ames-Brady. My daughter. I call myself a father of 3 but I'm not. I'm a father of four. When I was 15 I got a girl pregnant. We were looked down upon, she was berated and called a whore. I was told I ruined her life and I was going to pay with hell. But we were excited. We named her Kiely after Kobe Bryant. We picked out clothes covered in flowers. Only flower covered clothes. We wanted her to love nature and knew she'd be as beautiful as petals, as strong as a stem and always have her roots to fall back on. Her mother and I are tall. We thought about how she could play basketball or volleyball. How all the other kids in her class would be so jealous of her natural advantage. She'd eventually get on the WNBA and the stadium would be cheering for Kiely. How her fans would argue with their friends ""it's kiely not kylie"". Her mother was as intelligent as they came, I was as dumb as they came. We wondered who'd smarts she'd get. I wished she'd be like her mum, get into medical school and cure cancer. ""The Kiely Cure"" we used to say. No matter what she did in life she'd be loved. We'd read her bedtime stories and finish them all off with good night I love you. She's scratch her knees in the playground and we'd tell her its okay you're safe. But none of that happened. 36 weeks in. 4 weeks till I'd meet my flowery, sporty, intelligent and loved daughter. ""She's stopped moving, I wonder if she's asleep"" She was born sleeping. I hate that it was 36 weeks. My other 3 kids were born before 36 weeks. If only. She was born on the 24th of January. We got to hold her, kiss her, love her and then say goodbye. The funeral was small. People still didn't like the teen pregnancy thing. We brought so many flowers. At the funeral people came up to me and told me I should be grateful that I didn't have to be a teen dad. So I pretended I was. Her mother and I drifted apart. I told myself I was grateful day in day out. Every time I saw a flower I thought of Kiely and told myself to get over it or be a man.",,False,False,parenting

But she sent me my sister-in-law's Facebook (I admittedly stay away from social media) and she had posts saying things like ""I don't condone violence but I have little sympathy for dead n---ers"" (in reference to a local shooting). I was absolutely shocked and appalled. I immediately went to my wife and told her we can't have her sister over and she got defensive saying people were entitled to their opinions and we can't thought police.

It's that apathy that has led to the death of children and it's the exact same rhetoric my sister-in-law is using. I am torn.

It was almost idyllic. Sadly, her mother passed away this year, and that's where everything began falling apart.

Right up until September. She got a boyfriend.   She didn't tell me she got one.   She had been inviting him over and going over his house without me even knowing this kid existed.   Looking for specific times she knew I wouldn't be home, lying about where she was going and who she was with, etc. This alone would have been fairly normal teenage behavior and the appropriate punishment was to be grounded for about two weeks.   First time I've EVER had to ground her.   But then I began digging and finding all kinds of other high risk behavior she'd been engaging in (vaping, etc). When I confronted her and extended her punishment, she and her friends began a concentrated campaign to (and this is a direct quote) ""take [me] down"". She carefully curated stories to tell police officers and CPS, who came and not only executed a search warrant on the house, but arrested me (where I spent the weekend in prison with actual rapists and murderers), and charged me with a second degree felony carrying 5-10 years in prison.

82,Are you considering therapy for parental regret/struggles? Here's what you should know.,"Hi, I‚Äôm a therapist, a mother of 3 daughters in their 20s, and have worked extensively with parents and children with family issues for over 30 years. I wanted to post this as a response to a post shared yesterday, but it is not here now. But I think this could be helpful, so I‚Äôm making this post. Firstly, IT IS OK TO NEED HELP. There is absolutely no shame in needing help. However, for therapy to work, you need to WANT to help yourself. Don‚Äôt listen to anyone who says unhelpful bullshit like ‚Äúyour needs, wishes and happiness ceased to matter the moment you brought a child into the world‚Äù. One of the first things I tell my clients is that ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt pour from an empty cup‚Äù. There is a reason flight safety instructions tell you to put on your own mask before assisting anyone else - because you are best equipped to help others when you have taken care of yourself and your needs first. You are best equipped to be a good parent when you are taking care of your mental health. Fill your cup. You are not the only person who has experienced feelings of regret. I talk to people like you every day. You are also not a bad person because you regret having your child. Any decision can be regretted. I also talk to people who regret their career, their marriage or divorce, bad financial choices. Not every decision turns out how you planned, and that‚Äôs normal. Don‚Äôt listen to anyone who tries to suggest you don‚Äôt love your child. You can absolutely love your child and dislike the duties associated with childcare. Saying ‚ÄúI would make a different choice if I knew then what I knew now‚Äù or ""if I woke up X years ago and was told this was all a dream of what being a parent is like, I wouldn‚Äôt do it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt love your child. People often come to the realisation they'd have made a different decision about something if they had more information at the time, or a better understanding of what the decision entailed. People often think something is right for them, only to realise it is not. Why do you think so many people change careers? Change jobs? Get divorced? It is a thing that happens. But not enjoying the lifestyle of a parent doesn't mean you don't love your child. You are not stupid or a bad or selfish person if you find parenting harder than you expected, less fulfilling than you expected, or find yourself missing your old life. There is a lot of romanticisation of parenthood in society and it sets people up for false expectations that are often not met, and can cause guilt when you feel disappointed by parenthood. When you have a baby, it can be Post Partum Depression. Both mothers and fathers can get Post Partum Depression. People will always jump to that. Sometimes, it is post partum depression. I can help with that. But sometimes, it is not Post Partum Depression. Sometimes people regret their decision to become parents. I can help with that too. I won‚Äôt rattle off a list of them, but there are so many reasons parents can regret their decision, ranging all the way from ""I just find it boring"" to ""I had a child because my spouse desperately wanted them, they were killed in an accident a couple of years later, leaving me alone with this child I never wanted in the first place"". Whatever your reasons are, they are valid, and expressing them to me helps me figure out how to best help you. A lot of people think talking with me a couple of times will magically make them love the life they either chose or have found themselves living but don‚Äôt enjoy (not all pregnancies are intentional, and fathers don‚Äôt get a say, which I agree with because of bodily autonomy, but it can be difficult to find yourself living a life you didn‚Äôt choose) It doesn‚Äôt really work that way, unfortunately. I can‚Äôt wave a wand and make you love parenting. What I can do is be a safe space where you can let your feelings out without judgement, help you come to a place of acceptance of your decisions, help you with coping mechanisms and strategies to make it easier to deal with your life and your feelings and to minimise the depression you feel. Regretting your child doesn't preclude you from being a good and loving parent. You can still be a good parent. You just have to be willing to commit to being the best parent you can be, showing up every day for your child, and showering your child with love be even if you don't enjoy the parenting lifestyle.",,False,False,parenting
83,My son got hit by a car. Vent and trauma advice.,"I'm writing this at 1.30 am because I just can't sleep. My little boy he's 4 got knocked down by a car while walking home from nursery. It all happened so fast. The most annoying thing is that we always talk about road safety and I make sure we stick to paths and hold hands while crossing roads etc. WE WERE ON THE PAVEMENT!! He was walking right next to me on the inside of the path (I always thought that was the safest so he's not next to the road) and then all of a sudden this car was backing out of the drive from a heavy slope. It hit him first and he fell down underneath the back of the car. Then the car hit me. Realising what was happening I started screaming and pushed my weight against the car and banging yelling to stop. I could hear him screaming under the car and he was making this weird panting sound. My whole world stopped and I was like this is it, my child is being crushed to death under this car. This cant be happening, I can't be one of those people that loose their child. I remember people screaming behind me, I looked down and he was lying face down using his nails trying to drag himself from under the wheel, that's not an imagine I'm ever going to forget I imagine. Eventually two men helped me push the car off of him. Another women pulled him out from under the car as we pushed. Next I remember sitting on the side of the road with him in my arms swaying and crying. He just kept repeating I'm okay I'm okay while sobbing. Someone must have phoned an ambulance because I just remember it being there really quickly. I just honestly couldn't believe he was alive and how did this happen all so fast. The man that ran him over was hovering over me apologizing but I still couldn't think straight. A lady was holding my hand and encouraging us to both take deep breaths but I couldn't really focus on what she was saying. She kept saying it's okay it's okay he's alive. The paramedic turned up and took him out of my arms and that's when I first saw the damage on his legs the were all bruised and road rash, the wheels of the car ripped his trousers clean off so it was just dirt and road rash. In the ambulance he just kept crying I was trapped the car was running me over. The ambulance staff did a great job trying to make him laugh they really calmed the whole situation down and I began to think more clearly. My mum turned up on the street outside the ambulance so I must have phoned her at some point. He napped all the way to the hospital he must have been so exhausted. We were there a long time at the hospital, it was a busy night. He eventually got x-rays and they came back clear. The staff said I took most of the weight of the car and if I hadn't been standing there next to him it would have been a different outcome. He is severely bruised on both legs. Esp his knees. He'll struggle to walk and he lost some of his hair and face is road rash. He has lost most of the skin on his ear. He lost lots of skin on the palm of his hands trying to pull himself out from under the car. He honestly looks beaten black and blue. We were discharged from the hospital a few hours later. I feel so so lucky he's alive. It was extremely traumatic for both of us. I'm dreading his reactions to being out and about, just to see the affect on that. We went back to the guys house to let him know he was alive because I didn't want the man awake all night thinking he had killed a child. He explained that he was fixing the breaks on his car and it slipped off of the bracket and rolled down the driveway. He wasn't even in the car, no one was. Someone on the street who rushed to help opened the door and pulled the handbrake. I guess it makes sense as to why I felt like the car didn't stop after it hit us and no one responded when I banged on the car to stop. I know I shouldn't be upset as much as I am Because people have lost children this way and he's alive and gonna be okay. I keep replaying it over in my head could I have prevented this etc. It all happened so fast. I just moved to a new town and am starting my new job tomorrow, while we were walking i was thinking about that, maybe if I was not so stressed about that would i have noticed the car in time beofre it hit him I just don't know. I just know I'm extremely thankful. I'm in his bed tonight holding him tight and stroking that little face, I'm so so lucky it really could have been a different story. Any advice on how to help him over the next few days dealing with the trauma. Thanks for reading. Go hug your kids.",,False,False,parenting

You could tell he had a developmental disability and his parents did not have the extra money to keep trying for the shark. My kid, not even 6, without me saying anything goes ‚Äúwow!

88,Babysitter left home for 40 minutes. What to expect?,"As title says, babysitter left our daughter (20 months) alone for 40 minutes sleeping. Full story: We hired our first babysitter ever and planned to have a nice night out at a small wedding. We were quite excited as the private babysitting service came recommended by our daycare. (they are associated with the daycare and families become members by being at the daycare). We left as soon as little one was put down to sleep. Babysitter left the house 15 mins after us. She did not return for 40 mins. We have the time stamps from our security doorbell camera. She told us after we reached her that she only ran out to the bus stop to get her wallet from someone that was waiting there. She also said she took the tablet as the monitor but she did not as we have the video of her. We also informed her that the door locks behind her so she had no way of coming back in if she gets locked out unless she calls us and we can remotely open the smart lock. My husband left the wedding and came home and just told her she isn't needed anymore. We reported this to owner of service. We are meeting her today. I would like to know what happens from this? It's such a crazy situation that I doubt anyone has had this happen but I am just wondering what to expect. EDIT: Took out a question.

94,Another parent was stealing my kids toys...,"Like the title says, another parent has been stealing some  of my 3 year olds toys for her own kids. My sister in law has been taking my kids toys when she comes to visit.  I never noticed her doing it, so I must have been out of the room when she did it. The first toy was s police car that lit up and drove around. My kid loved it and took it everywhere, slept with it, and fed it. So when it went missing, we searched and searched,  called around ( my brother and SIL included), before coming to the conclusion that she must have forgotten it at the playground. I felt terrible because it meant so much to her! How could I be so careless! Then her OTHER favorite toy went missing a month later. A T-Rex doll. Not a cheap one either, but a Papo one that I got from a clearance sale. She had moved on from her police car (finally) and had this dinosaur toy in its place. We did the same song and dance as the last time. We called everyone looking for it and no one had it. Well wouldn't you know it, but one day my SIL is at the park with her son and they have all of his trucks there. My girl sees HER police car amongst his toys and cries out in protest. ""But that's my police car  mumma!"" I calm her down and ask my SIL where she got the car, because we misplaced my girls. She says that she found it....um, ok. I tell my brother what happened and he explained that it just showed up one day and that his wife is always bringing random things home and he can't keep track of it all. I explained that I knew it was ours because my kid painted it all up with nail polish...and sure enough, the one his son was playing with had nail polish all over it. We get the car dropped off (broken I might add) and my girl is ecstatic. I realized that the dinosaur might have met a similar fate, so I visited my brothers house and noticed that there was a papo t-rex in a pile of toys matching all the wear and tear marks that my daughters had. I brought it to my brothers attention and he fully admitted that his thieving wife was nicking other kids toys right out from their parents noses, and that she might be stealing other things as well. He said that it was out of his hands because he had no proof and she always claimed that the parents either gave her the items or she found them. But it seemed really fishy to him.",,False,False,parenting
95,Might be an unpopular opinion and don‚Äôt want to be a party pooper but wanted to discuss,I see a ton of parents around this time of year pull a variation of the prank on their kids where they ‚Äúeat all their Halloween candy‚Äù and then film their reaction. As would be expected the kids are upset. I just saw an influencer on Instagram do it and I know there have been viral videos. I think that‚Äôs just bullying and mean and I am lost for why this is supposed to be funny. I took my little one out and seeing the pure joy and delight on his face as he got candy was just everything. He got all dressed up and we all went out and it was pure joy. You can tell that it‚Äôs a joy for the older folks who are handing out candy to participate because little kids in Halloween costumes are so cute. I cannot imagine stomping on that evening by pretending to accidentally eat all his candy and then filming him in that moment of sadness. I‚Äôm sorry if I seem judgmental over a prank but this is something that doesn‚Äôt seem funny to me. We do pull harmless pranks around the house so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm against them but this one is so sad and awful.

96,"""No talking at the dinner table""","My husband and I got into a parenting argument and he told me, ""Go ask Reddit."" So here I am. Our son started solids last week and we had our first family dinner at the table last night. My son took a bite of his pureed sweet potatoes, then looked up and said, ""Aya ah!"" I responded and we had a jolly good time going back and forth. Later in the evening, my husband, who clearly had a heavy issue weighing on his mind, finally said to me, ""When he's older, I don't want to make a habit of talking during dinner."" According to my husband, talking at the table distracts us from mindful eating and can lead to obesity. I told him that family dinner is supposed to be a time for family's to talk and connect. He disagreed, and was apparently raised in a household that had quiet dinners. In my mind, this is ridiculous, but it does genuinely appear to upset my husband and I want to see his perspective fairly. What do y'all think? Please be nice in the responses because we'll both go through them tonight. EDIT: To clarify our meal habits pre-baby  - we used to work opposite schedules, but I recently became a stay-at-home parent. Pre-baby, when we did have time together, we would honestly just eat at different times. He likes to stand in the kitchen and eat quickly. I like to sit down at the table and eat at a normal pace. We are trying to break that cycle and eat together. And regarding his family, I've never experienced silent dinners with them, so I didn't know this was a thing he valued. Husband says it's a value that he lost after leaving the nest, but now that he has a baby, he wants to reimplement to ""help"" out our son. Thanks for all the responses everyone.

98,A mom took my kid's phone during a sleepover,"My 13 year old went to a sleepover at a friend's house. I knew of the parents (mom is on the board of a charity I support, dad works at a business that competes with mine) but hadn't met them. My son texted me about an hour into the sleepover that he was having fun. Then another hour later he told me that nothing objectively bad was happening but that he wasn't having a great time because the other parents were really strict (my kid is pretty well-behaved, and is a rule follower. So that comment was weird to me.) Around 2AM I got a ""come get me"" text. My son has never asked anything like that before.  I immediately threw shoes on and rushed out of the house in my pajamas. I asked what had happened. My son said that he'd asked to borrow a phone charger. The kid hosting the sleepover didn't have a phone and told my son to ask the mom. The mom told my son that children aren't allowed to have phones in her house and took his phone into her bedroom. Then I guess the host kid got in trouble for not telling his guests about the no phone rule. At some point the mom had gone into the living room and a different kid sneaked into her room to liberate my kid's phone.I asked my son if he told the parents he was leaving - he said the dad had been awake and turned off the alarm so he could leave the house. The dad didn't ask why he was leaving and my son didn't offer a reason. My son was in the driveway when I got there. I've obviously had a conversation with my son about not going into people's rooms without permission, and about adults being able to set their own house rules. But... Was she out of line for taking his phone?

100,What NOT to say to older children with baby siblings,"Or, a lesson in basic etiquette. I have a 9 year old daughter and a 4.5 month old son. The other night we went out to dinner for a belated Father's day celebration. It was my fiance and I, the kids, my dad and his girlfriend, and my sister and her fiance. Everything was going well; I had the baby in my lap and my daughter was sitting across from me. About halfway through the meal, a woman comes in with her family and starts absolutely gushing over the baby. No surprise there; people love babies. If she had just stopped herself then, everything would've been fine. (I know a lot of older siblings have a hard time with all the attention going to the 'cute new baby,' but thankfully that hasn't been the case with my daughter. Like me, she hates being in the spotlight and shuns any form of public attention, so if anything she's grateful to have her brother take the focus off her.) The woman didn't stop there, though. She actually made a point to compare the two kids by pointing at the baby and saying ""right age,"" then pointing at my daughter and saying ""wrong age,"" then repeating herself to really make sure the message sunk in, like she really needed my daughter to know there was something ""wrong"" with her. The implication seemed to be that because she's not in the cute baby stage anymore, she must be some kind of a problem in my eyes. Her reasoning was apparently that my daughter appeared to be at the age when everything is just nonstop pestering and asking ""why? why? WHY?"" in response to anything. I am not one for confrontation, like at all, but I at least managed to push through the shock of what she said and stick up for my daughter. I told the woman in no uncertain terms that no, that's not at all what she's like, and that my daughter is actually pretty independent and a hell of a lot easier to take care of than a fussy, screaming newborn. (Obviously I wasn't quite so eloquent in the moment, but that's the essence of what was said.) So how does this woman choose to respond and end the conversation? ""Oh, so your parents have a built-in babysitter!"" REALLY? It was like the cherry on top to every stupid, insensitive thing she could think of to say to her. No lady, my daughter is not a built-In caregiver just because she's a girl with a younger sibling. She is as much my child as her baby brother, and she will never, ever be treated as somehow less than just because of her order of birth or her gender. She will never be burdened with taking care of a child that we chose to have, unless one day when she's old enough she decides she wants to babysit, in which case we will absolutely pay her for her time. And no, she is not the ""wrong age""-- if anything, I love her even more at this age, seeing her grow into her own person, forming her own opinions, and getting to see a glimpse of who she'll one day become. I truly cannot fathom how some people think saying these things to a child is a good idea. Please, I beg of you, if you can't say anything nice, keep your damn mouth shut. *Obligatory edit to say holy shit, I did not expect this much of a response on my first ever Reddit post.

101,Tell me your kids‚Äô most expensive fibs.,"My 11 yo came to me at bedtime in a panic. He had suddenly developed this dramatic purple swollen rash around his mouth that he noticed while brushing his teeth. His lips were swelling up and felt numb and his tongue felt funny. Oh crap, off we go to the ER because it looks like some kind of dramatic allergic reaction. They get him in fairly quickly, get him on benadryl, but no epi because it wasn‚Äôt affecting his airway. Keep observing him for a while, then after about 3 hours total discharge us with more benadryl and instructions to follow up with the ped if the rash doesn‚Äôt go away, and to keep a food log to identify his allergy. So fast forward two days and the rash is still there, getting better VERY slowly but not really responding to the benadryl, so I call and drag him to the pediatrician. He asks in the parking lot if there will be needles. I say I don‚Äôt know but they may need to run an allergy panel. It‚Äôs finally this point (in the elevator on the way up) that he sheepishly asks if his rash could possibly be caused by sucking on a smoothie bottle to see how long he could make it stick to his face. We were already there and would have been billed as a no show if we just left so we went in and I made HIM tell the doctor why we were there.

103,I‚Äôm jealous of people that have their parents to help babysit from time to time,"I just needed to vent this one out.

104,My parents are gaslighting my child,"Background: We've taught our son about bodily autonomy, the concept that everyone owns their body and their own personal space, and it's not OK to touch someone or get in their space in ways that make them uncomfortable. Also, you don't get to decide what's uncomfortable for someone else--each person gets to set their own boundaries. This is, as far as I'm aware, a widely taught an uncontroversial concept. Last weekend my son was at his grandparents' house for a few nights. When I was talking to him on the phone, he mentioned his grandmother had pinched his buttock in a way he wasn't comfortable with, and that it hurt him. I reminded him (with grandma on speaker phone) that it's not OK for anyone to touch him without his permission, and she apologized. I thought that was that. When I picked him up, my parents angrily confronted me about the phone call. They felt like I was accusing them of being child molesters. I think they were having trouble with the concept of bodily autonomy extending to the entire body and personal space, not just private parts. I told them I believed them that there was nothing sexual about it, but that wasn't the point--consent doesn't only apply to sexual touching, and any touch without consent is inappropriate. They went on to say a whole litany of awful things, including (a) I was being ridiculous, (b) my concept of personal space is wrong, (c) he doesn't get to decide his own boundaries because he's a child, (d) he changed his story about whether the pinch hurt or not and so he's a liar (which is of course entirely beside the point), (e) that we aren't welcome in their house unless I apologize to THEM for making them feel bad, (f) that I'm being manipulated by my child, and (g) that he will end up getting taken away by CPS because I'm teaching him that all touch is inappropriate. I of course stood up for him and was told not to return. Later, my son told me they had yelled at him, accused him of lying about his comfort level with the pinching and touching, made him cry, made him feel like everything was his fault, and compared him to the ""boy who cried wolf"" (apparently implying that nobody would believe him if he were sexually assaulted, which I found particularly repugnant). I suspect he may have ended up telling them the pinch was OK because he felt bullied into compliance, which ended up making it worse for him because then he was called a liar. I got a phone call from my parents, which I took on the off-chance that it was an apology. It wasn't. In fact, they demanded an apology from me. Needless to say, I will not be leaving my son in their care again. I'm not even sure we'll be seeing them again under any circumstances, unless by some miracle they come to understand how awful their behavior was and truly repent. The whole experience also ended up reactivating some of my own childhood trauma. I'm not really sure what the point of this post is. I'm furious with them, but I'm also mourning the loss of a branch of my son's extended family. I just feel sickened by the whole thing. I know I'm not in the wrong here, and I did the right thing for my child, but it's all just so heavy. ------------------------- EDIT: Thanks for the thoughtful comments, it's really helped me reflect on the situation and what it all means.

105,UPDATE:I 16(M) have a 4month old daughter - ex gf wants to go to College,"original post Idk why I feel like I need to update but here it goes, Tiff and my dad went to the school and were able to get her enrolled in college courses because of her grades. She wont graduate H.S way too fast but she will have enough to finish h.s hours by next December so 6 months early. She reapplied for assistance we got a voucher for daycare so now its 50 dollars a week. She quit her job so she can focus on school but she doesnt start college until spring so thats cool it gives her some time. She still wants to be a nurse so thats cool too. I got a new job that pays more as a forklift operator and will give me an internship for welding which I wont be able to start until november/december until i finish my classes and then i have to do a 2 month internship but they are paying me really good. I started Monday. My dad and I had a long talk about my fears and he reassured me that its ok to be scared but we have a game plan. He is fixing up the basement to make 2 bedrooms and a living room like a little apartment because he said Tiff and I will need space as we grow. He wants me to buy the house when i am 18 like he did with his parents and he will help me pay it as long as Tiff gets to stay until she finishes college and let her make her own choice. We all agreed this is the best option and we are all really much happier now. I guess I just needed to let it out. Tiff and I are great while being parents is hard but its been good now that we feel a bit more secure. My mom and Tiffs parents still havent spoken to us because we arent married. Which does make me sad but its ok we have my dad - Tiff's grandparents bought her a car and said thats all they can do for her and not to contact them again until we are married. The car needs some work but I am going to pay for it to fix it up. It needs brakes, suspension and some regular maintenance. My dad finally told me what all happened and I didnt know but it made me open my eyes to all of this. My dad met my mom in H.S too and they were together and got caught kissing. Since my mom's family are Baptist they forced my dad to marry her. I didnt know in Missouri parents can marry their kids at 15 which is why my dad has been so protective. They were going to marry Tiff and I because she was pregnant and when my dad stepped in they couldnt do it. My mom and Tiffs dad went and got a license for us and were going to marry us in their church. I guess I wouldnt have minded marrying Tiff but I would rather do it later. But yeah thats why they arent talking to us. My dad did say if that happened he would helped us get it anulled but we have no intentions of speaking to them right now. He explained that Tiff is stuck and while I might be afraid she is even more afraid because she has no one and I need to reassure her we are here for her as a family. I guess I couldnt see it that way and its good that I talked to him. I hugged my dad and i have been hugging him every day now and its nice its made us closer. All of this information made me pretty sad and grateful at the same time and it helped Tiff and I really start talking more. Like we talked but we didnt talk and I didnt know she was scared too we are now doing days for us to be kids as my dad says. So we both hang out with our friends who still talk to us at least once a week and Tiff and I do a lot of stuff on the weekends now that she doesnt work. Like taking Jelly to the park and going for walks and we did a pumpkin patch. Jelly seems to be happier too and Tiff doesnt seem as tired anymore. anyway thanks everyone for the help, tips and encouragement. I doubt I will update again and just lurk for parenting advice.  Edit - just want to say thanks for thinking I am a great dad but I dont believe it just yet. I depend a lot on my dad to help me. Tiff and I are trying we do take parenting classes that they offer us a lot of advice and we have made friends there which is nice. But I dont think we would be this prepared without my dad. Also Tiff is on WIC and we take parenting and co-parenting classes its my dads rules.",,False,False,parenting

It takes her longer to understand nuances of the game. She gets distracted. She's immature for her age socially and emotionally. We joined this league in the next town over because she wanted to learn to play basketball. She walked in day 1 not knowing a single other girl here. She had never played before. She's shown up. Every. Week. She hasn't complained about the Saturday 7am wake up to get here. She hasn't asked to skip. She supports her teammates. She cheers everytime someone gets a basket. She can't stop smiling when she manages to score. She takes constructive criticism from her coaches. She keeps trying. She's improved so much from week 1 in November.

So, today he went to pre-school and came back and told us a story. His best friend who is Finnish with very woke parents saw his socks and told him that pink is for girls!

114,My son‚Äôs school wouldn‚Äôt allow him to eat his sandwich at lunch.,"Update: I just got my son from school, and they replaced his sandwich with a baggie if Cheerios, which he didn‚Äôt eat. My son was also really sad about the whole thing and said, ‚Äúthey threw my sandwich out!‚Äù Since they didn‚Äôt even replace the sandwich with something equivalent, I‚Äôll be contacting the school to raise this issue. This makes me more upset than the phone call. My son (4) is unbelievably picky when it comes to eating. He has issues with certain textures and it‚Äôs hard to find lunch items that I can put in his lunch for him. At home, he eats peanut butter sandwiches, but since the school is nut free, I make him sandwiches with Wowbutter. He has been having them since school started in September, and I made sure to send a note to his teacher to let her know that it might look like peanut butter, but that everything in his lunch is nut free. She sent a note back thanking me and letting me know that was fine. Just today, I get a call from the school administrator asking if my son‚Äôs sandwich is made with peanut butter. I explained that it‚Äôs Wowbutter, which is made from soy, and assured them that I‚Äôve made sure that nothing in his lunch ever has any nuts at all. The administrator, rather rudely, said that he would not be allowed to eat it because it ‚Äúlooks like peanut butter‚Äù. She told me that even if it‚Äôs nut free, if it looks like peanut butter, it‚Äôs not allowed. They threw it in the garbage and asked if they could feed him something from the nutrition bin. I‚Äôm flabbergasted, annoyed, and now at a total loss as to what kind of sandwich I can put in my son‚Äôs lunch. ETA: I‚Äôm not about to go off raging to the principal or getting a lawyer.

118,Thinking of divorcing wife over telling daughter she never wanted to see her again.,"My wife is from a foreign country and has a child from her previous marriage. We have been married 3 years and the child is now in elementary school. I have adopted her officially as well. The daughter is full of energy. Since elementary school, she has started testing the boundaries, especially regarding manners and lying. Wife has hang-ups about daughter being too thin and always emphasises that daughter must eat a proper lunch at school. Sometimes she forgets because she was playing with toys, etc. Wife was checking daughter‚Äôs bag and found many coloured pens missing. Daughter had given them away to friends. Daughter also lied about eating lunch. Wife spanked her. Wife threatened to send her back to her home country. Things got resolved when wife calmed down and daughter promised not to lie anymore. Today daughter brought her toy digital camera to school and again didnot eat lunch. She had also lied to me and said she was putting the camera in her bedroom but instead put it in her schoolbag. Wife was furious. Spanked daughter till I stopped her. Told me not to cook dinner for daughter, but I did anyway. Wife had always had tantrums, but had never sent daughter to bed without dinner. Wife threw away the dinner. Told daughter to leave her bedroom and that she never wanted to see daughter again. I put my foot down. I tried to calm wife down that it was enough, but wife was angry at me. I had always believed my wife had the best interests of daughter, but for me, sending a child to bed without dinner is to cross a line. Daughter is also 6. For sure she will lie again. How serious is she going to escalate punishments? So I said if she really never wanted to see daughter again, then we should divorce. She asked me: ‚ÄúYou want her?‚Äù in a disgusted voice. I said yes. Wife said ok then, let‚Äôs divorce. I hope I‚Äôm doing the right thing. I am always tired of walking on eggshells around my wife. I am okay with her being angry with me. I know how to pacify her. But her just pushing more and more things onto daughter just seems like abuse to me because daughter will just obey her and take in anything.",,False,False,parenting

120,[TW] CPS is coming today and I am scared.,"I am the mother of a 16 year old child. Her father has been in and out of rehab throughout 2021. She has seen him in the worst state of mind. He has been drunk, high, and neglectful. He lost his job and company car due to COVID. He always had addiction problems which is why we are not together. I left him when she was 2. We have a custody agreement. He was always out late at bars and did not care about her. When it was his weekend, he would make up for it by buying her extravagant toys and even a cell phone at age 8. He used to play an unhealthy dynamic of ""don't tell mom"" which turned into a sick game throughout her teens... ""Don't tell mom I drank too much last night"" turned into ""Don't tell mom I punched a hole in the wall or you may never see me again."". Well, she came to me this year because the game turned dark. She told me dad was forcing her to cuddle with him the past year because he was ""lonely"". He would come into her room intoxicated and would not leave her alone. I was sickened by this. She also had a breakdown and told me he once commented on ""how big her tit's have gotten."" The next day, he told her not to tell me because she would be in serious trouble. She told me anyway, in a panic. She has severe panic attacks this summer. I knew something was up. She hasn't seen dad since April because his drug and alcohol abuse is absolutely out of control. He had the nerve to text her while she was at work and told her he is about to get a job soon (lies). He said ""don't tell mom but I know a way I can sneak you over here."". She told me. I immediately texted him to knock it off and told him I know of the abuse. He then texted our poor child and shamed her for confiding in me. He told her she is not allowed to see him ever again and it's all her fault. He said that was their secret. I printed all these out and called CPS this morning. I also called a lawyer. CPS is on their way over. I am praying to GOD this child says something, stands up for herself, and uses her voice to speak! She keeps telling me she needs to ""help"" dad. She said if only she could ""be there"" for dad. She said dad even told her not to go to therapy because it is for the weak and therapists ""mess with your head"".",,False,False,parenting
121,Accidentally found out 12 y/o son is gay,"Me (32m) and my wife (32f) are the father of kids 14m, 13f, 12m, and 10f. Our 14 y/o has always been on the more feminine side, liked playing with barbies growing up, was into youtubers who‚Äôs main audience was girls, ect. When he was younger we had suspicions he would turn out gay, so we always showcased our support so we knew he‚Äôd be comfortable if he was, but once he hit puberty it was clear he was into girls, always talked about them, never showed interest in boys romantically, and started dating a girl a few months back. Our 13 y/o had a crush on a boy in Kindergarten and he eventually became her ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äú (at the time we thought it‚Äôd just be a cute little kid thing that didn‚Äôt last long), but she‚Äôs still dating him and they have been on dates. He is such a sweet boy, and they couldn‚Äôt love each other more. Our youngest had a crushes on boys before, but hasn‚Äôt ‚Äùdated‚Äù anyone yet (which she‚Äôs 10, we don‚Äôt expect her to. My 12 y/o is a sweet boy, but we (largely due to stereotypes, which you can blame on us), never suspected he was gay. He‚Äôs always been a rough and tumble type of boy, very athletic, on his schools football team. We made sure never to push the ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù stuff around any of our kids, but he‚Äôs always been very traditionally masculine. When it came to crushes we always used gender neutral language around all of our kids (i.e a special someone vs special girl), our son always told us he didn‚Äôt like anyone. I was cleaning his room when I noticed a Valentine‚Äôs teddy bear, an antique high school football programs (my son collects them), chocolate, and a card. The card was open, I went to close it so I could put it away (wasn‚Äôt thinking much, thought it was from wife to him, but then I saw ‚Äúto Connor; love, Braxton‚Äù on there. I know Braxton is almost always a boy‚Äôs name, our son had never mentioned a boy with this name being his friend. I leave the Valentine‚Äôs day stuff where it was and stop cleaning his room, hoping he wouldn‚Äôt know I had seen that when cleaning his room. My son came home a few hours later (he was at a friends house), wife and other kids were out shopping at the mall. I am not good at lying/hiding secrets, my parents are and were very gentle and supportive, so I never felt the need to hide anything from them, so I never developed those skills, whenever I was hiding something (which was pretty rare), I quickly cracked. My son is a never ending eating machine and despite just eating lunch a few hours ago, wanted to make nachos with me (cooking is something me and my children bond over, so I can never say no to a request), we had started making the nachos, but it stopped when he asked if I was ok, he could tell from my face something was up. I tried to brush it off, but he asked again and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared, are you ok‚Äù, I sat him down and told him that I loved him and always would, I then told him what had happened. He told me for the past 3 months, him and this boy have been ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, but were constantly flirting with each other, and that Braxton had officially asked him out on Valentine‚Äôs day, which he accepted. The chocolates, bear, and football programs were his Valentine‚Äôs day gift. My son had asked me for money a few weeks ago saying he was going to the store to buy a gift for a friend, I gave him money, which I now know was used for gifts for Braxton (my had planned on asking him out officially to, but Braxton asked him out first). He told me he was already out to his football teammates and our 14 y/o son, but no one else. He had came out on Instagram publicly a few hours later (which is how my wife and his sisters found out, as they were still at the mall and my 13 y/o had checked his story). We live in a progressive area, so he‚Äôs been accepted well. His boyfriend‚Äôs parents know they‚Äôre a couple, and his boyfriend is openly gay to their school as well. What are some resources we can use to help him understand himself? He‚Äôs been asking some more questions about dynamics in a gay relationship, and also been asking about gay history (he‚Äôs a very smart boy). We love him and want him to have a safe, healthy, age-appropriate relationship with both himself and his boyfriend.",,False,False,parenting

123,The village is gone,"I‚Äôm pretty sure most people will agree with me on this but especially for the people who were born between the 80s-2000s. The village is gone it has fucked off somewhere. I remember being at my grandparents house damn near every single weekend, staying weeks with them in the summer, and feeling like they were happy to have me and my siblings around! My mom needs 10 business days if I have to do ANYTHING for her to watch my kids and none of my children go anywhere until about 18+ months oldish most of the time and even then it‚Äôs ‚Äúyou‚Äôre coming straight back after right because I have things to do‚Äù. My parents used to just show up at my grandparents and drop all four of us off no questions asked and it was anyone‚Äôs guess how long we would stay, we just got picked up when we got picked up. She says she enjoys being a grandma but gets so frustrated when my oldest asks to come over and 90% of the time it‚Äôs a hard no, if we have to see each other of any reason she usually wants me to come to her car or me come inside by myself to avoid the kids seeing her and asking to do anything with her. My mom is not an old grandmother either she is only 46, the village is only accepting photos now I guess? Edit: Okay so this blew up and I‚Äôm just coming here to make one thing explicitly clear, I don‚Äôt not expect my mother to watch my children what I was saying was simply a comparison of my childhood and how she had help but I can‚Äôt get any from her because she is not interested in being a grandmother, my husband and I provide all of our children‚Äôs needs by ourselves and most of their/our wants, yes my oldest has some behavioral issues and it was a struggle getting into a rhythm of figuring out what works but we are all really happy and everyone is taken care of he works 12 hours because he works in a hospital not because he has to. It makes me sad and frustrated that she clearly just has no interest in helping me or my kids when she had it from my grandparents and then wants to turn around and pretend like she‚Äôs the best. My kids virtually never stay with her and I only ask for help in instances where I have to do something of necessity such as going to a drs appointment Not to mention I watch and run my youngest sister around constantly at the drop of a hat with 3 kids whenever I am needed, my mother does not work a regular job and sets her own hours and schedule every single day I am sad that it is a double standard of the fact that she had all the help and it takes me giving birth to not be rushed through something and please don‚Äôt forget in the original part to this I said that my children do not go anywhere for any amount of time until they‚Äôre a year and a half old. No one expects her to watch or raise my kids I would just like some of the same loving help and kindness that my grandparents gave her and me.",,False,False,parenting
124,Finally got a diagnosis. My 7 year old was diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.,"My youngest was adopted from foster care as a baby. There was evidence of drug use but her birth mom denied using drugs or alcohol during pregnancy. The drugs were obvious since our daughter was born dependent. We knew there were some issues. She was diagnosed with a developmental delay when she was a toddler. She was born prematurely so her doctors believed it could be linked to that. She got PT and OT and speech since she was a toddler. We have always had concerns about FASD but she does not have the facial features associated with it. We went through a diagnostic process and confirmed that she is indistinguishable from a child with FASD. Low body weight, poor coordination, hyperactivity, difficulty with attention and memory, difficulty in school, learning disabilty, speech and language delays, lower IQ, poor reasoning and judgement skills, and vision issues. We knew all of these were issues and have been working on them but being able to tie it to something after 7 years is a relief. We struggle a lot with her poor reasoning and judgement. She trust others so much and is easily led into negative situations. It is very difficult for her to make thoughful and informed choices. She has always just picked the last option. If you ask if she wants to wear a yellow shirt, red shirt, or green shirt she will always pick the green shirt even if she really wanted the yellow shirt. That is a small example but it extends to every aspect of her life. We were told that we have been doing everything right so far. Knowing what is wrong can help us continue that in the future when these issues can become a much bigger or more dangerous ordeal.",,False,False,parenting

The kid was freaked and asked for her not to make him go with me. I told her she brought me the wrong child. This kid wasn‚Äôt even in 2nd grade. She paged the room again and nobody could find him. We finally figured out she paged the wrong room, when she got the right room, there was a substitute and a ton of confusion. I was starting to freak out, telling them I dropped him off this morning so I knew he was there somewhere. All the true crime stories were running through my head.

128,Grocery shopping isn‚Äôt self care,"Can you please help me reiterate that grocery shopping isn‚Äôt self care to my husband? Sure, I didn‚Äôt have to take the kids with me and he stayed home with them both so I could go alone. It didn‚Äôt mean I had a GREAT time. I had to do necessary errands in order for the household to function right. I had a list of the things I needed. Got them and left. I didn‚Äôt browse leisurely. I didn‚Äôt stop and get coffee. I went for the necessary things and came home. Maybe next time I will browse and get coffee. He asked something to the degree if I had fun and I responded with a strong no. I mean why does grocery shopping get to be considered my alone time? ETA: I have a six month old at home who is breastfed and I don‚Äôt have much of a supply at home.

129,UPDATE: nanny stopped loosing when I stopped replacing,"Original Post : https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/r6ctqx/our_new_nanny_is_loosing_everything_we_own/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf Just wanted to share that the losing and misplacing of things came to a slow stop once I stopped instantly replacing them! I still highly doubt she was stealing; she just had the attitude that our stuff was disposable bc it didn‚Äôt effect her when it was lost or misplaced, as I immediately rushed to replace it. So I made it effect her. She approached me saying there were no more gloves and I said that was a shame because I didn‚Äôt have time that week to get another pair, so I guess she was going to have to use the snowsuit with the built in mitts everyday until I can replace them. This tactic really worked and she hasn‚Äôt lost anything in weeks.  If she misplaces something now and asks where it is I say I‚Äôm not sure I guess you will have to look for it. Before I would show her where it was and tell her I had found it x y or z and where it should go. Just thought I would share: problem solved simply by making the lost items her problem",,False,False,parenting
130,Something I will never feel guilty about,"Is buying my LO a book whenever I make an order on Amazon or am out doing grocery shopping. If I see something appropriate when I'm shopping, I'll grab it, no questions asked; I used to smoke cigarettes pretty regularly until about a year before I got pregnant and buying a book or 2 a week is still significantly less expensive. LO is almost 11 months old and is loving to flip thru board books and all but demands I reread certain books all the time and I really can't get enough. I don't care if I have to read ""I Believe In You"" for the 12th time in an hour; she'll sit in front of me and will turn each page as soon as I'm done. Last week I couldn't believe how excited she got when I opened an Amazon box, pulled out the book and said ""Guess what? We got a book!""

131,I 16(M) have a 4month old daughter - ex gf wants to go to College and I am worried,"Before anyone says anything - yes I knew about condoms. I was just dumb. Story time. My parents divorced when I was 10 but lived primarily with my mom. Tiffany's (16) parents are together. When our parents found out she was pregnant her parents kicked her out and my mom kicked me out. So now we live with my Dad. During the pregnancy my Dad took my mom to court and got primary sole custody - I know what this means because I had to go to court for my daughter. He sued Tiffany's parents for legal guardianship and they now pay child support for her and they are pissed and refuse to talk to us. I am in my bedroom and my daughter is in her bedroom and my ex is in the ""guest room"" that is now hers. My dad made a deal  with us. We live with him until 18 with no rent payment at 18 we need to decide what it is we do.  I wasnt really that good in school and Tiffany is an A student. So I took my GED and my dad got me into Welding school. I finish in 2 months. I also work full time so I do welding school at night. Tiffany goes to school and works on the weekends at Wendy's. This whole thing is a huge ordeal. We literally have no life. My dad helps but not that much because he feels its our responsibility which I agree but still sucks. I work 6 am - 3 pm at a warehouse and go to school from 6 pm to 10 pm. Tiffany is home by 230 and picks up our daughter from daycare. WE help each other a lot and then I head off to school and she stays with her at home until I get home and do it all over again day after day. When our daughter was born my dad made us go to court, we have 50/50 and I dont pay child support because she lives with us. Because I work full time I can get healthcare for my daughter and myself and that sucks it costs me 300 dollars a month and daycare is 400 a week. Literally Tiffany works just so we can pay for daycare and I pay for everything else. When we are short for cash my dad will help because he sees we are trying. My dad has been our rock. When we are tired and exhausted he will step in and give us a break here and there, but he makes sure we have everything we need and keeps us motivated. Tiffany wants to apply to college soon and I am worried because I dont want to keep living with her and I dont think I can keep our daughter full time as a welder working 12 hour shifts. But she says she will start at community college and work but wants to stay with us living together since its easier. Since I will be working and it will be best for us to stay with my dad. But my dad said at 18 we have to pay rent. She doesnt mind but I dont want to keep living with her because we arent together. I am unsure how to tell her this. My dad thinks she should stay with us as long as she is a full time student to finish her degree because i am already getting my career. I just feel that all this is unfair because the burden is on me. I guess I am ranting because I am scared and unsure of what all this means. *Edit - I guess my thing about her living with us is that we are more like siblings now. We get along and joke and stuff but since she is my ex I feel weirded out by it. Maybe I need to take a breather since everyone is saying its a good thing. Also I needed to hear it from other people and not just my dad and he is pretty solid and i should thank him maybe take him for dinner or something. 2nd Edit - My dad isnt kicking us out at 18, but he wants us to be realistic to the world and pay bills. The money he gets from Tiffany's parents he just gives it to her, she is saving up money for a car and uses other money for her specific foods and clothes. Before i became a dad my dad always wanted me to live with him at 18 and figure it out and stay with him and save money to buy a house. When he found out I was going to be a dad he wasnt mad but disappointed and said everything has to change. He also is paying for my welding school of 20k and he bought me my car but I do have to pay my own insurance. He does help as long as he sees we are trying and not being lazy. When school recently started he took my daughter to daycare every morning and helped Tiffany with a routine to get school work done. Final edit I have to get to class now. Tiffany wants to be a nurse or PA but the college told her nursing school is hard to get into and its best to have a high school diploma which is why she is still in high school and working the weekends. But someone mentioned a dual thing for community college and we will look into that. So we couldnt get daycare assistance because we are minors and they used my dad's salary. The funny thing is I cant open a checking account for myself because i am a minor but the bank allowed me to open a childrens account for my daughter because I am her parent lol the irony. I read every single comment and its given me a different POV and I guess college seems so far and I was counting years but its really not that bad she is like a sister now and those who asked I doubt we will get back together honestly I am not thinking about anything like that right now I am too tired to think of a relationship or that type of future.",,False,False,parenting
132,"Total cringe moment, I felt my son's embarrassment 10x. Here's what happened...","Just happened... My son is in the 3rd grade, and they have a ""compliment box"" in the classroom. Every week students are allowed to write one compliment, and they're read out loud by the teacher every Thursday afternoon (perhaps with some censoring). Today there was a reading of these compliments. Anyway, my son is just like his dad, proactive and likes to get things done ahead of time. So in advance of an upcoming playdate (which happened yesterday), on Tuesday he put a note in the box saying that he had so much fun during the playdate with Johnny (not his name). That may have been premature... during the playdate my son had to poop, and he's a bit poop shy so he wouldn't go there. He ends up pooping his pants a little, which he tries to keep a secret. That may have worked except Johnny's family puppy got a whiff of the poop and needed to investigate. My son was trying to push the dog away when he slipped, landed on his butt, and the poop must have squished between his cheeks in such a way that it fired up his crack, out his pants, and got on the dog who proceeded to eat it. Embarrassing enough as is, but all adults were adults about it (and got a good laugh). BUT, the story somehow circulated and very quickly my son was known by his classmates for pooping on Johnny's dog during a playdate. The icing on the cake, the next day (today), with his entire class knowing this, the teacher read the compliment out loud that my son had such fun during this playdate. It was bad enough before, but I just learned about the premature compliment today. UGHHHHPUIHREDGLIFUGHDGLIUYRHTDF. The cringe is real. How are you guys doing?",,False,False,parenting
133,My humble brag,"This is actually about me and I'm not much of a bragger but this is something near and dear to my heart. We've all read those heartbreaking stories, where a kid invites their entire class to their birthday party and no one responds and / or shows up. A couple of hours ago I recieved a random group message inviting us to a bday party for a kid I've never heard of. I was about to (politely) text them back telling them that they have the wrong number, but a couple of things gave me pause: the address of the party is about a 7 minute drive away. That seems highly coincidental when you live in a large city. And, the kid happened to be turning the same age as one of my kids. Right away, the sender got a couple of rude responses, like ""I have no idea who the hell you are"", and ""why are you texting me"" etc. The person then responded with the name of the school all of our kids went to together, and it finally clicked: they are new to the country and English is not their first language, hence the rather abrupt message. Anyway, I felt terrible about how the 2 snarky parents had responded, so I immediately texted everyone back to say that my son would be so excited to celebrate their son's birthday with him and we would be there. Then 4 others responded to say the same thing. This kid is not spending his birthday alone. That is all.",,False,False,parenting
134,I refused to let my daughter get her hair dyed now her classmate's mother is angry with me,"My daughter (5f) asked me if we could dye her hair Lilac and I refused. So my daughter Taylor wants to dye her hair Lilac because one of her classmates has blue coloured hair and now she wants to dye her own hair to her favorite color but she has dark brown hair and to make it lilac they'll need to bleach it a lot and I think she's too young to bleach her hair rn. I told her about all the cons of bleaching but she won't listen as she's very young, I don't want to ruin her hair with bleach, she has long curly brown hair. I think she'll grow up to regret it as bleach has lasting effect on hair and my daughter loves her long hair, she would cry when I took her for her trims. So my daughter must have said this to her classmate Georgia and her mother called me up to convince me. She told me to let my daughter have fun with her hair and let her enjoy her childhood. While her daughter had very light blonde hair they didn't need any bleaching so I don't think she understands but she kept on telling me if I keep restricting her from this age she'll do everything without telling me when she grows up but I told her my daughter can make decisions for herself when she's atleast 14 and before that she wouldn't really understand the logical consequences or anything but that woman kept arguing so I told her what I do with my daughter is my buisness and kept the phone down. I asked my sister about it and she told me to let my daughter do this and it's not that big of a deal. Idk what to do should I just let her do it or should I stand my ground? Anyone with experience of bleached hair aftermaths? Update: I told my daughter about the lilac hair clip extension idea and she agreed and I am going to try out purple hair wax, and hair colour chalks out too. I am not giving under peer pressure but I feel like she's very excited about some pop of colour and I want her to feel good.

I just tell her no that the doctors know how to do their job and that it'll all be fine, but she's smarter than that and knows better. Today she told me, ""Dad, I'm scared, I don't want to go so soon."" This was after her mother told her several times she hopes she dies from it and has refused to come and see her for years even before this whole thing, and being hated by her mother was taking it's toll before, but it's even worse now. But I've just tried to be strong and just make it seem like everything's gonna be fine, but we both know she's getting worse with each passing day. I wish we got just wake up and have this entire thing be over with everything going back to normal, and nothing be wrong.

136,Disappointed in humanity,"Today was the farmers market, and the local medical clinic has a tent set up. This specific clinic serves the low income community primarily, medi-cal recipients, and has a WIC office attached to it. For those who don‚Äôt know, WIC stands for ‚Äòwomen infants & children‚Äô and is a program that gives food assistance for mothers to get fresh fruits and vegetables, and some staple grocery items, as well as baby food and formula. They also provide excellent education and other resources for mothers in the community. So back to the story. The WIC office sent out a notice to the recipients in the community that they would be giving away $30 grocery vouchers to be used at the local farmers markets for locally grown fresh fruit and vegetables. They do this once per year, and are allotted 400 vouchers total, there are over 1,000 families who are serviced by this particular WIC office. To get the voucher, we are instructed to go down to the farmers market and receive it at the tent. The vouchers are first come first serve. So, naturally, there is a pretty long line at the tent this morning, all women with strollers and small kids/babies. We had to wait for a long time, since there were so many people. I have never experienced such judgement from the community in my life, as I did today. It was borderline humiliating. I consider our city to be pretty open minded. But we had vendors complaining about the line to the event coordinator/city. Dirty looks from vendors and people attending the farmers market. Karen‚Äôs asking everyone in line what we were doing, and the sidelong glances when they explained WIC. White upper class moms meeting for brunch and farmers market staring at the line of primarily Hispanic and Spanish speaking mothers waiting in line for the coupon, whispering amongst each other. Karen‚Äôs asking the WIC employees loudly ‚ÄòWHAT KIND OF ASSISTANCE ARE THESE PEOPLE GETTING?‚Äô Lots and lots of staring. An entire high school class of photography students came by and ogled us, some commenting amongst themselves ‚Äòwe might see Juan‚Äôs mom here buying some frutas‚Äô. I got my coupon and left.

143,[serious] don't make the same mistake we did with my stepdaughter,"I just wanted to offer some advice. I don't want anyone to make the same kind of mistakes we made. Be like my stepdaughter's mother. She was an incredible parent. Always show up for your kids. You will regret it and its awful the damage it does to them when they feel like a parent does not love them. Here is my story.  i know that we are in the wrong so please be kind. My stepdaughter is getting married and told my husband he is not walking her down the aisle. I get it, I really do but its so hard to face the consequences of what we did. SD's mother (can't even use the word BM because it feels disrespectful since that lady is superwoman) and my husband broke up when SD was very little. husband was not ready to be a dad, and BM tried so hard to make him want to be in SD's life. He came around when she was a few months old and BM was so happy that her little girl's dad wanted her before she was too old to realize he didn't. husband  stayed in his daughter's life until she was around 7 and he moved to another state for a job. He loved SD and promised her he would be back as soon as he could. BM offered to pay for SD to visit and him to come home if it meant them having a good relationship. husband didn't want to ask her for money and then he met me. I knew he had a daughter and talked to her on the phone but was selfish and was happy that he lived far because I wanted my own kids with him. SD used to call him begging to come home. When I got pregnant, I suddenly felt immense guilt. She was only a little girl who missed her dad. I told husband that he needed to do better. We ended up moving back to her town and our first was born. SD was so angry and acted out to a point where her mother said that we could only have visitation when she was there because she didn't want her daughter to suffer or grow up with poor behavior. Then we had another kid. SD grew up a little and came around more. She told husband she hated him and he cried and cried because he regretted moving. Then, her mother died and SD came to live with us at 15. It was so hard on her. She hated me but came to me when she needed something (which she never did) because she couldn't stomach being around her dad. She was such a good girl. Her relationship with us became cordial after years of therapy and husband prioritizing her. She has grown up to be this smart beautiful cancer doctor (her mother passed from lung cancer). She is charismatic, kind, and funny. She is sweet to our children. She is an angel of a human being and its all thanks to her mother. She barely speaks to us after she turned 18 and told husband the day she lost her mother was the day she became an orphan. She is getting married and he doesn't get to walk her down the aisle. He doesn't deserve it All we get to feel is thankful that she invited us and that she is marrying a good man who will keep her safe and happy. SD is an incredible person and we missed out. I see so many posts about stepparents and stepkids and wanted to warn everyone not to be like us. Maybe one day she will let him into her life more than he is now, but we weren't there when she needed us, and now she is an adult and no longer needs us. This is the biggest mistake of my life. all children can be hard to be around. they reject you and want another parent. Never stop showing up.

150,"Has ""Gentle Parenting"" Gone Too Far?","I have a 2.5 year old. For anyone who has had one - you all know this age is rough. I am part of am amazing group on Facebook of people who had the same due date month - so our kids are the same age. The number of times I see posts from moms who feel like they have failed because they get... Frustrated. They have to walk away to calm down. They have to force their kids to brush their teeth and worry themselves sick about harming their kids' body autonomy. They beat themselves up, feeling like they have fallen short of some expectation because they aren't in constant emotional communion with this other human being at all times. How did we get here? We are setting ourselves up for failure if the only thing we allow ourselves to feel as parents is total calm and bliss at all times. That's not possible and I'd argue it's incredibly harmful. ""it's okay to feel mad. It's okay to express how you feel"" - we give this message to our kids but not to ourselves. Why this double standard? Honestly, the expectations feel so stifling to me. The list of things that I ""should"" be doing at all time is completely unrealistic. And looking at other parents, they obviously feel the same way. The bar is too high, and we're making ourselves miserable. Where is the joy in parenting? Also, where is the authority? I am not saying we need to crush our kid's spirits into submission - far from it - but being the parent does mean I am the one with the responsibility  to make sure the things that need to get done, get done - whether my kids LIKE that or not. I wish we could find some kind of balance - but I blame social media here - that balance feels long gone. Edited to add: I see a lot of folks pointing out that this is not what Gentle Parenting is supposed to be. And I agree. But it is largely what it has become, from what I have seen. The phrase has been commandeered by social media ""parenting experts"" and the meaning is actively shifting. Which means that the definition is changing, whether that's what we want it to be or not. See one of the below posters' perfect example of what another ""expert"" says to do when your toddler's banana breaks. That's how gentle parenting is being labeled and defined today, and that's what I mean when I ask if it has gone too far. Maybe the post should have been ""Has the term Gentle Parenting Strayed too Far"" or more plainly ""Are our expectations as a generation totally untenable?"" Edit 2: This post was not to diminish what these women were feeling. They were trying to be supportive of one another and commiserating over how hard it is to parent kids. And we need that. But I think I just got angry and heartbroken over this pervasive sense of failure that was apparent across the whole discussion.

152,I hate being a parent,"EDIT 20 September:i woke up today feeling worse than I've been ever since this started. Got the kids ready and did the preschool drop off, instead of cycling i walked with the stroller (30 minutes), went with the small one to a doctor appointment and went and change therapists as well. Then went home and the little one was screaming the entire way( 40 minutes without stop). Rest of the day went as usual. Thing is I didn't lose it, i didn't hate parenting, there was even good parts of it. Manage to read books to the kids without feeling like it was a chore. Don't know if the rant yesterday helped me release some pressure or just connected me to similar people. But thanks! From the bottom of my heart, thank you! I really do hate being a parent. Unfortunately, this won't be a post with an humorous twist. I have three kids, two girl ages 4 and 1.5 years old and a 5 months old boy. And life sucks. There's so much screaming, whining and crying. Sleep is f*KD. House is always a mess. There's always someone trying to eat my snacks. I have no privacy. I have nothing for me...i have zero interest in sex. No will to go out and be with other people, mostly because they usually have kids as well. I'm tired and always in a pissy mood since the time i wake up to the time i go to bed. But apparently i am lucky? The psychologist doesn't think I am depressed. Apparently, being smiley and social in Sweden means you're not that depressed or at all. I have parental leave for 480 days per kids, so yay me. I'm a guy, happily married with most of the household chores divided fairly enough, meaning there's a lot of women out there way way way worse than me. It doesn't matter if I try to be patient or mindful. Every tantrum and whine just drains me, more and more. Parental advice sucks. Because this isn't about my kids. They aren't that awful. To be fair they are pretty sweet and caring. But they are toddlers, so they are draining. But what the hell is wrong with me, that everything is a trigger. Why am I always angry? I dunno. I just hate feeling this way. EDIT: I'm addressing a few things that get repeated often. First, i didn't feel this way before. It's recent, about a month or two. Second, i had a vasectomy, so no more babies. Third, no family support whatsoever. Fourth, thanks for the advice. I'll try to switch psychologists, try to get more me time, probably working out.

As he kept stumbling on those things, I would suddenly look up from my phone sitting next to him and realize he had clicked on some botched scary ‚Äúkids‚Äù video that advertised his favorite characters and seemed harmless in the thumbnail. This is when my husband and I started to get uncomfortable. It felt like we were having to heavily monitor his TV time, when usually that‚Äôs a time for us to get things done or relax ourselves. In just the few weeks he‚Äôs been watching Youtube, he has given up all of his other favorite educational TV shows and movies filled with lessons on life.

156,BCS - A condition rarely talked about,"BCS, otherwise known as Broken Cookie Syndrome, is a real condition that affects 50% of toddlers and children between the ages of 1 to 6 years old. BCS is a condition of which a child is unable to cope with their cookie or cracker being broken, chipped or unsymmetrical. Experts believe that BCS is a condition which affects the frontal lobe (reasoning, memory, behavior, etc.), the Parietal lobe (reasoning, sensation, language, etc.), and the Temporal lobe (emotions), in which dopamine levels initially peak with excitement of a cookie only to suddenly drop once the child realizes the cookie is flawed. Disappointment is felt at first until the neurotransmitters within the brain are overrun by waaaahh chemicals leading to emotional and physical outbursts. Symptoms of BCS include crying, thrashing, arm flapping, feet stamping, spinning in circles while screaming simultaneously, head shaking, throwing objects, hitting and even biting (please see Piranha Child Syndrome for more details). Most children outgrow BCS as their brains mature however, BCS can continue into adulthood of which the diagnosis is changed to BCI or Broken Cookie Intolerance. There is some controversy with how to treat a child with Broken Cookie Syndrome. Some believe in Tough Love Therapy where the child is left to express their emotions until they choose to eat or not eat the offensive cookie. Parents must refuse to supplement another cookie in replacement. Other treatment plans include BCS Repair Therapy which involves the use of icing to temporarily keep the cookie together, giving the illusion that the cookie is whole so that the child can ingest it. The latest treatment plan called ‚ÄúYou Snooze, You Lose Therapy,‚Äù are usually only effective for children with siblings. The idea is that the parent offers one cookie to each child and in the event that a child refuses their flawed cookie, the other child (usually the eldest), is given the cookie instead. While seemingly unfair, this treatment plan is conducted with the hope that the child suffering from BCS will quickly realize that their sibling received two treats while they received none, thus preventing a similar meltdown in the near future. The most controversial treatment plan is to eliminate cookies altogether, a cold turkey approach until the child‚Äôs brain has matured enough to cope with broken cookies. The good news is, most children with BCS outgrow the condition and lead healthy and normal lives. Although BCS has been around for many years, it is only recently identified as a legitimate condition within the medical community. Research and experiments are continuously being conducted with the hope of finding appropriate therapies and coping mechanisms for children suffering from BCS.",,False,False,parenting

159,Really confused about.....Disneyworld,"So, like many parents with young kids who are into the world of Disney, we decided to make the pilgrimage to the Magic Kingdom this year.  And I have to say I found the whole experience really weird / intreaguing from a socio-economic point of view. Disney is EXPENSIVE.  Like, just park tickets for a family of 4 during the vacation season runs at just north of $500 per day. Per day!  And that's before the $15 hamburgers, let alone any consideration of fast passes etc. And don't even get me started on accommodation or proper dining. I took a quick look at the resort options, noped the hell of there and got an air bnb offsite. So entering the park, I was expecting to see people fanning themselves with wads of $50 dollar bills, clutching their monacles / diamond necklaces securely on the rides or sending their au pairs off to get Tarquin some fresh hummus. Far from it. It was just the kind of honest regular folk that you'd bump into at Target or Walmart. Which left me thinking. How does this work?  Do people save up for a once in a lifetime trip to Disney?  Is my concept of cost stuck in 1970?  Is the Walt Disney Corp. just price gouging regular folk into debt? I really don't understand. Any insights from the parenting world? (I would post this in a Disney forum but am too worried about getting a hostile reception). Edit: thanks everyone so far for the fascinating replies about how you do (or don't!) Make a Disney trip work for you and your families. I've learned a lot.

169,Get your kid into therapy BEFORE they need it,"Title. I'll share a bit about why its so valuable IMO:  I first introduced my child to therapy when she was in 1st grade/6 years old. At that age, therapy is mostly just playing with toys or board games while having casual conversation - my kid loved it. She looked forward to it every week to play, and she also knew that it was a safe space for her to share anything she wanted or needed to. That positive first impression made a huge impact, and we as a family never made it a 'big deal'. It was just a place to go to talk, it didn't mean she was wrong or broken or wierd or anything. As a parent, I viewed it simply as an acknowledgement that I don't (and never will) have all the answers. Later, when she was struggling with anxiety in middle school, she asked me herself if she could go back to therapy. Because of her initial positive experience, she didn't hesitate to ask and I didn't hesitate to agree. (and not make it a big deal). Another good experience. In High School, we had a family upset. This time I was the one who brought it up. She wasn't having any emotional struggles at that time, but I wanted a strong support structure in place if that was to occur. Because of her (now 2) previous good experiences, she readily agreed. She's been seeing this therapist for 3 years now, and as a parent, knowing I have another 'team member' for my child's emotional/mental support is priceless.

When he's with my daughter, he's constantly grabbing for her, even if she's clearly not up for it, giving her kisses over and over, licking her on the cheek, tickling and trying to give her shoulder massages.

176,9 year old was sent to the principal for showing classmates the definition of ‚Äúvagina‚Äù,"My 9 year old son (almost 10). Had a standardized test today. During the post-test free time, he thought it would be funny to look up the definition of the word ‚Äúvagina‚Äù in the dictionary and share it with his friends. We are a pretty open/science based home. A penis is a penis, a vagina is a vagina, not a ‚ÄúWeiner‚Äù or a ‚Äúhoo-hah‚Äù. I‚Äôm currently pregnant and he knows how that happened (sperm meeting egg), no stork stories here. The teacher called my husband, who just called me. I have to admit I had a pretty big laugh about it when he told me, but I need some guidance. I want to let my son know that what he did was inappropriate without making the actual word ‚Äúvagina‚Äù inappropriate. And advice on how to proceed is appreciated, I have pick up in 2 hours! EDIT: For all of those extra sanctimonious folks, my son knows what a vulva is. Today he specifically looked up the word VAGINA so that is what I used in my example. üôÑI came here asking a valid question looking for legitimate advice. Sometimes I forget how ridiculous Reddit is. EDIT 2: okay so I spoke with my son and got some more color to the story. His ‚Äúfriend‚Äù (we will call him Finn) showed him where to find the word in the dictionary. I put the word friend in quotes because whenever this kid and my son get together it‚Äôs always trouble. My son then decided to show a couple of his friends. Test taking time was over, it was completely free time. He brought the dictionary over to two of his friends and said ‚Äúlook what I found in the dictionary‚Äù. The teacher went over to him immediately and questioned what he was doing. He shut the book and then she asked him again and he opened it and showed her. She immediately put him out in the hallway and sent him to the principal. We discussed appropriate time and place for these things and also let him know that not all kids are raised the same way he is raised and it is not his place to teach his friends about sex organs. That is their parents job, and if their parents have decided it‚Äôs not time for them to learn that‚Äôs on them. Additionally, we discussed that if any girls overheard him laughing at a part of their anatomy that it could make them feel bad and ashamed. That made him feel bad, I could tell he had not even considered that angle. All in all it was a pretty productive conversation I think!",,False,False,parenting
177,I am the father of a newborn. Please tell me it gets better...,"(Apologies for the rant but I need to get this off my chest and it would break my family's hearts to hear this.) We thought we were ready for a kid. We have the money, desire, a stable marriage, and all kinds of support. I was wrong. Three weeks in and I have never regretted anything more in my life. The pregnancy was extremely difficult. The labor was long, traumatizing, and ended in cesarean. My wife has been in constant pain and depressed for months. The only thing that went well is that the baby herself is very healthy. I knew it would be challenging. I did not expect to resent another human so much. I resent her for how much pain she put my wife through. I hate looking at her. I hate the sound of her cries. It takes all my willpower to handle her gently as I spend most of my waking hours attending to her and my wife's newfound needs. I know my daughter is innocent. I know it's not her fault, but I all I see when I look at her is a symbol of pain and looming responsibility. I should love her. I should care about her well-being, but I can't bring myself to feel any empathy toward her. We go through the motions: feeding and diaper changes every 2-3 hours, holding her until she falls asleep, reading/singing to her, doctor's appointments, staying on top of laundry and dishes (so many bottles), etc. I have almost zero time to myself and I haven't even gone back to work yet... I can barely manage to get a shower in. Walking the dog is my favorite part of the day because I can get away and not think about her for an hour. I've started fantasizing about my daughter dying of SIDS in her sleep or never coming back from a dog walk. I feel like a terrible person for how relieving that sounds. Please tell me it gets better. Please tell me Parenthood isn't just a nonstop treadmill of maintaining your kid's constant needs. This feels so bleak I don't know how long I can keep this up and it's only been 3.5 weeks... UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your support and advice. It's very reassuring to read so many stories from parents who also struggled in a similar way and made it out the other side loving their kids. If anyone else is struggling and identified with this post, there's some great people in these comments. Many people are adamant about seeking out professional mental health resources, and I wanted to mention that both my wife and I are discussing options as well as family/friend support.",,False,False,parenting
178,Daycare is keeping on teacher who cut my child's hair,"I recently put my 18 month old daughter into daycare. The room has 4 teachers. 3 of the teachers I really like but one rubbed me the wrong way from Day 1. She tried to lecture me about overfeeding my child, which I don't. She has a healthy appetite and is big for her age (she's tall, the height of an average 3-year-old), so the pediatrician approves her diet. I at this point did say something to the director and was told that she was an old-school teacher, and they'd speak with her. And for a week or two, we'd have no issues. I don't believe in gendered clothing. I foster children so I get a lot of donations. Sometimes my daughter wears clothes marketed for boys, it's not a big deal. This teacher has made comments about the outfits, saying she looks like a boy and would look pretty in dresses. I reported this and was told they'd speak to her. I honestly wanted to pull then but my husband told me I was overreacting. The last big problem came with my daughter's hair. She has a ton of it and I'm currently in the process of growing out her bangs. She actually does pretty well with her hair being in a ponytail, though occasionally as toddlers do will rip it out. The teacher complained, again, and I said if she rips it out, just leave it alone, she'll be fine, her hair isn't that long that she can't see. I dropped off my daughter on Friday with her beautiful long hair and bang-free. When I returned in the afternoon, she had bangs. I was pissed and the teacher admitted to doing so. I went right to the office and filed a formal complaint. I was apologized to up and down by the directors, assuring me this was not okay. At all. I said this teacher's actions were not okay and I hoped by Monday they would no longer be on the staff. Returned yesterday and she's still there. I asked the director why and she told me that the matter was handled but they couldn't tell me what repercussions were taken. I replied it should've been her termination. I ended up leaving with my daughter and working from home. I spoke with the owner later in the afternoon and I was told that the teacher had received serious repercussions that they still could not discuss but they would remain on the staff. I want to pull her from the daycare. My husband thinks we should instead request a room switch. But to me, this should be a firable offense. Am I overreacting here?",,False,False,parenting
179,Help finding the most annoying toddler toy ever,"I have to be fully honest, I'm looking to punish my brother by finding the loudest, most annoying, easiest to set off age appropriate toy I can find for my nephew (2.5 years) whom I'll be looking after this upcoming week.

180,Why are the expectations of grandparents so low?,"My husband and I both grew up with grandparents who lived with us/right next door and played a huge role in our childhood. I still call my grandma 2x a week and we visit his grandfather at least once a month to bring him lunch and hang out. My parents being so awesome with my niece contributed to my decision to have kids. For example, when my brother and SIL got covid, they took my niece for 2 full weeks to let them recover, and they both still work. I see people post here about how they are stressed and wish they had more family help. There are always comments with tons of upvotes shaming them and telling them their parents don't ""owe them anything"" and they ""raised their kids and are done now"". It's really hard to raise kids without any help, and wasn't commonly done in the past. It's possible, but it's hard and takes a toll. I also think it's good for kids to interact and have relationships that extend past the nuclear family. It seems like a lot of people think that kids are just some sort of obligation you quit after 18 years? I wouldn't want to be in a family where we define our relationships what we strictly ""owe"" each other. Part of the reason I wanted to have kids is because I want to have a family- I look forward to (hopefully) having grandchildren, or grandnieces/nephews one day and helping them as well. I understand some people have abusive parents and have to keep their kids away to keep them safe, but I keep seeing post after post of people who can't get their parents to take any interest in their kids. What causes this? I am an American and from a region of the country that is stereotyped as cold/independent, and this level of atomized individualization is shocking even to me.

181,My 6-Year-Old Niece Saved My Son's Life Tonight,"Tonight we were at my parents' house having a BBQ.  Kids (6, 5, 4, and 2.5) were at the kid table and the adults were at the adult table.  Arms' length away.  Very visible and close.  Everyone was eating and having a great time.  Until my 6 year old niece ran over and started shouting, ""Mommy, mommy Son (5) needs you!""  Everyone turned and looked at Son to see his eyes bulging and his hand at his throat, choking.  My first thought was that he was playing, my second was no wait that's real, my third was I gotta help, and my fourth was a sigh of relief as my SIL (nurse) got up behind Son and have him the Heimlich, which caused him to vomit up a piece of hot dog bun.  He was fine, everyone was good - shaken of course - but okay. If my niece hadn't said something, nobody would have noticed.  It was quiet.  It was fast.  I had JUST glanced at them less than 30 seconds ago before turning back into the conversation I was having.  My niece is a hero and I told her so, as is my SIL for her faster-than-my reaction time.  I am tearing up thinking about it.  I keep asking myself if my SIL hadn't been there would I have remembered how to do the Heimlich myself or would I have blanked?  I don't want to think about it. I'm just thankful for my niece's quick thinking and my SIL for being there, too. EDIT:  Thank you everyone for the advice, the shared stories, and awards.  I appreciate every one of them.

182,"I‚Äôm a parent, my life is not go with the flow anymore","Just have to let this out. Last night, my best friend asked me if I could give her a ride to her doctor appointment today because she was afraid to drive back alone after all the intense blood work they‚Äôd be doing. I was all for helping her because she‚Äôs been having weird dizzy spells for awhile and I wanted her to be safe. She said her husband, sis in law, nobody else could take her, so I called up my mom and asked her if she could take my 16 month old awhile. My friend‚Äôs doc is 45 minutes from us, so we would be gone awhile, and my mom requested I pick up groceries for her while I was there, ha.

183,I didn‚Äôt have what it took to be a stay-at-home-parent. (A love letter to SAHPs),"As I enter the last nine days of my pregnancy I‚Äôve been asked by several friends and family if I plan to return to work after my eight weeks of maternity leave. Make no mistake, my family needs my income, and I don‚Äôt really have a choice in the matter. Even if I did though, my answer would be the same. Several years ago, I was between jobs, and was given the opportunity to manage a few Facebook pages for six months, for a company based out of China that needed an English speaker to simply make posts. The job was completely home-based, took maybe 5-6 hours a week, and paid as much as my previous full-time job. I figured to myself, I would take the job and be a stay-at-home mom for the six month period. I thought it would be easy. I was wrong. The Facebook job itself was super easy. The stay-at-home parent part was the hardest job I‚Äôve ever had. I am currently a middle-school Special Education teacher who focuses on behavior and intervention, in a title 1 school, so when I say it was a hard job, I know what I‚Äôm talking about.  Here are some of the things that made me want to quit being a stay-at-home parent. Socialization- I like being part of a team. I‚Äôm naturally an introvert, so one of the only ways I get socialization is through my work. Despite what you might think, introverts still need some socialization for their mental health. I felt so isolated and alone being a stay-at-home parent. Being accomplishment-oriented for self-worth- I thrive off of positive feedback, both from myself and others. As much as I think the ‚Äúperfect life‚Äù would be getting to relax and watch Netflix all day (that‚Äôs not what being a SAHP is, I just mean in general), I feel incredibly anxious and stressed if I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm contributing to something greater than myself. I was unable to find a sense of joy and accomplishment in things that were just ‚Äúexpected‚Äù of me. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was making the world a better place by changing a diaper, doing the dishes, or mopping the kitchen floor. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I WAS making the world a better place for my family. My work WAS valuable. I had just been trained by society to believe that those things were expected of me, and the bare minimum, so I couldn‚Äôt get over my own feeling of inadequacy. On top of that, nobody else treated me like that was valuable. Nobody patted my back because the baby was clean and fed, or the dishes were done. It was SO MUCH work and nobody gave a shit. Which leads to my next point‚Ä¶ It is SO MUCH work - People without kids, partners who work a full-time job, and even society as a whole, do not fully grasp how labor intensive being a stay-at-home parent is. So many people think you are laying around all day chilling with your kids. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, daycare costs are out of control, but there is a reason they get away with charging so much. The job is HARD, and they aren‚Äôt even expected to clean your house and cook dinner afterwards! Trying to explain to others what you do all day, or why you are exhausted, is also tricky. It changes moment-to-moment, so you just say ‚Äútaking care of the house/kids‚Äù and to the uninitiated, that sounds super easy. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs also not a full-time job, it‚Äôs three‚Ä¶ which leads to my next point‚Ä¶ It never ends!-",,False,False,parenting

192,"Our first grader did community service for saying ""what in the world?!""","Our son (6) has been attending school since August. Today, he came home and told us that he did community service during recess for using foul language. What it was was that he put on a vest that said ""community service"" and picked up trash while his classmates ate and played. He said he felt it was unfair because according to us (me and his dad), his words aren't bad words. He just said ""what in the world"" when he saw something that surprised him (which he later specified that it was the unusually large number of people in the restrooms). In our family, we don't really throw cuss words around but to compromise and let everyone have a way of expressing themselves, we use ""what on earth"", ""what in the world"", or replacing the bad bits with words that have the same initial. E.g. instead of what the fuck, we say what the flop. Our son uses what the hedgehog or what the hamster most. Anywho, back to the story, he said his teacher said she was having none of it and immediately referred him to the principal who made him do community service for recess. He said he felt like a bad kid for getting in trouble and while we reassured him he did nothing wrong, I just want to get outside perspective into this before we talk with the school in the morning (I'm typing this late at night). Is that expression really bad? He didn't use it to hurt anyone's feelings or to be mean. He didn't use a slur or any generic bad words like fuck or shit or something. How to best approach this?

195,Trucker with a suggestion for road-tripping parents this coming summer: teach the arm pump,"I'm an OTR trucker. I spend weeks/months at a time carrying refrigerated freight (mostly food) from producers to grocery distribution centers and wholesalers. I'm the guy who makes an eggs, bacon, frozen waffle, and orange juice breakfast possible; for instance. All this time I'm away from my own family, home, and hometown. It's a tough life as any trucker will tell you --'it ain't for everybody' you'll often hear said-- but it's one we love because it pays well and provides a critical service to our nation & economy. So I spend a lot of time on the road, talking to other truckers and watching 'four wheelers' (private passenger vehicles) doing their thing. One thing you ALL need to know is this: You can scroll through the posts over at the truckers subreddit for evidence of this. There have even been other reddit posts on the subject. We love it when bored kids hang their arm out the window and pump for the air horns. Not kidding. It's enough to make a trucker's day. A lot of drivers are like me. We miss our families, and the chance to be a hero to some kid by tooting our big air horns is just so heartwarming and fun if we see them pumping we're gonna' toot. The exception to this rule is if we're in the city or tight traffic. Air horns can inflame an already sketchy situation by scaring unprepared drivers so if there's a chance we're going to cause an accident by sounding the horn most of us won't (with immense regret I assure you). I've prepared a crappy MS Paint diagram to show you where your kid's best chances of getting a horn are. From roughly the driver's window until you're maybe 50' in front of the truck's front bumper will have those pumping arms in full view.

196,"6-year-old asking ""What if I can't run fast enough?"" after active shooter drill","My first grader had an active shooter drill in school and came home quite scared. She asked if the bad guy is in the same room as her, but she doesn't have energy to run away fast enough, what should she do? I don't know what to tell her. We live in CT and the recent Oxford shooting brought back memories of the Newtown massacre. It feels especially raw this year because my child is now the same age as the little kids who were murdered. I keep imagining her facing a shooter and just being overcome with terror. I had not talked about mass shootings with her before, but now that she had the drill at school, I feel like I should talk to her about it, I just don't know what to say.

198,Hot Dad vs Toddler Mom aka Swamp Monster,"There‚Äôs a hot dad at the park. There are never hot dads at the park, and that‚Äôs just the way I like it.

I didn‚Äôt have any interest in appealing to this other ‚ÄúHot Dad,‚Äù who probably rolled out of bed, into the shower, fell into yesterday‚Äôs t-shirt and shorts, and still left the house looking like an Abercrombie model. So why I was I suddenly unnerved and annoyed at his arrival at the park that is usually, gloriously, Hot Dad-Free? Because being in the presence of such an effortlessly beautiful human shone a harsh, ultra-HD light on my painful transition into my second year of motherhood: I have become a swamp monster. Picture it: like a caricature straight out of Ren and Stimpy, there were mushrooms growing between my toes, an oil slick on my head, purple bags beneath bloodshot eyes, and green smoke emanating from my armpits. The worst part was, I tried today. I really did. For Christsakes, I even wore a bra, which my poor neighbors can attest doesn‚Äôt happen often. Ever watch videos of zookeepers wrangling baby pandas? That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like ‚Äúgetting ready‚Äù with a one-year-old. My white-haired angel is either two seconds from toppling head-first into the empty tub as he reaches for a bottle of shampoo or holding onto my legs and screaming because I haven‚Äôt looked at him in ten-and-a-half seconds, so he‚Äôs certain I‚Äôll forget him forever (this must be a biological mechanism; I have no other explanation for it). On the rare occasion that I manage to run a comb through my hair, and slap on some eyeshadow and Carmex, I flash a smile at the guy handing me an iced mocha in today‚Äôs drive-thru line and realize I forgot to brush my teeth. Again. I avoid Mr. Abercrombie, with his stainless shirt and sweatless brow, and retreat to the safety of my own backyard where the neighbors are used to the hairy beast that roams our side of the fence, and the ‚ÄúHot Dad‚Äù that loved me before he was a hot dad and I became this, waits to give me a kiss and tell me I‚Äôm beautiful. I don‚Äôt believe him, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. His adoration despite my condition renews my optimism.

The whole family went to the beach and she threw her pacifier at the waves (we picked it up when she was distracted) and told her a mom fish had taken it for her babies, lots of celebration from the fam, it felt like an episode from Modern Family. She told everyone at the airport her good deed, I am so proud of her :) I don't know what is but there's something very symbolic and powerful about saying ""goodbye"" to someone or something while standing next to the ocean.

200,"Wife about to realize she spoiled our kid, and that backfired. What to do now?","This is not an easy subject to talk about. We never have been on the same page with my wife regarding what to buy for our kid. She had a very poor childhood and clearly tries to compensate now, literally buying everything either she or our son likes. I had a lot, I mean a lot of debates with her regarding this behavior. There are countless resources and studies on the negative effects of ""instant gratification"" and co. Emotionally-wise, financially-wise, psychologically-wise, you name it. Still, she wasn't about to listen, and closed such discussions with ""but we can afford it and he deserves those stuff."" (No, actually we couldn't afford it, but that's another story. This is not a financial subreddit and I try to cope with that problem too.) Whenever I objected, wife had a side conversation with our son, claiming that ""Daddy is mean and he doesn't want to buy you this present."" Slowly something died within me and I accepted I cannot have a word on this, despite I was well aware of the potential consequences. Fast forward to the present. Not only our kid's room, but practically the whole house, including the basement is full of his toys, stuffed animals, clothes, backpacks, shoes, etc. We are literally drowning. And for what good? It turned out that he became a really spoiled boy by the age of 7. He demands new toys all the time. Doesn't want to do any chores, just watching TV. He lies about what is going on in school. He barely accept ""no"" as an answer. It gets harder to get him satisfied. I could continue, but I guess you see the pattern. What actually has changed: my wife starts to realize something is really wrong here and maybe ""we"" have done something wrong in parenting. In most of the cases I tried to stay silent, just listened, and raised the topic of ""instant gratification"" only once. She went NUCLEAR. Like how do I dare to criticize her and why I haven't told that before (what...?) I really care about my son. I know he is not lost, just needs a proper guidance to get back to solid ground.

201,Am I Wrong About this School Project?,"My kids‚Äô school is having a Thanksgiving party next Friday. My younger daughter is in kindergarten, and she came home last night with instructions for a craft project that we are to complete for her to wear to that party, as apparently this is something the entire grade does. Essentially we are being asked to make a Native American vest out of a pillowcase and to decorate it with ‚ÄúNative American symbols‚Äù, and they provided a guide of symbols that you could include on another page. Options include fairly benign things like canoe, antelope, and fish. However, there are also symbols for smallpox (which is the profile of a Native American‚Äôs face covered in spots), war bonnet, gun, and tomahawk, among many others. The assignment also requests that you come up with a Native American name for your child, such as Little Bright Star or something based on their personality traits. I find this assignment racist (EDIT: maybe racially insensitive is more appropriate) and problematic, and unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt the first time we‚Äôve seen it. My older child was in kindergarten at the same school three years ago, and at the time we voiced our concerns to the principal, who said she was unaware of the assignment but gave an excused absence for our child to not attend school that day. Three years later, they are still doing the same assignment, which makes me wonder if I am overreacting about this, as they obviously didn‚Äôt feel the need to change or discontinue the project. Any thoughts? UPDATE: My husband sent an email to the school principal, superintendent, and president of the school board, so we‚Äôll see what happens. I don‚Äôt have any plans to send it to the media or put it on social media, as this is occurring in a fairly rural area in the Deep South and I worry about being connected to it and negative local reactions.

Not because I don't appreciate them now as 20-somethings -- I do -- but because I will see my grown kids for the rest of my life (with luck!) but I will never again see those cute little grade school kids who brought me so much joy for so many years:  There were those times we slept out on the deck during the summer and that one clear night we woke up soooo cold we had to scramble back into the house together. The twilight evenings we rode our bikes down to get post-dinner ice cream. There was the the evening I taught them to play Risk and we howled with laughter as we attacked each other's armies, and the night I made tacos and they were so silly so we called it the ""Burrito Jollies"" and that was our term for silliness for the next few years. There were all the nights I drove them out to see Christmas lights, and the Christmas Eve Eve I brought home arts supplies and the three of us made a Christmas Board Game together. There were the times I took them to the pool, and that one magical Labor Day where we were the last people to leave the pool so the pool workers gave the kids a bunch of prizes (we took a picture and I have that picture prominently displayed in a leather journal where I documented my days back then). And all those many many nights we got pizza, made popcorn, and watched a family movie together. My ex -- their mom -- was a good mom when they were in preschool but was gone for most of their grade school years, which means many many evenings and weekends after school it was just the three of us (the two kids and I). And although I was so exhausted, and it was so very hard to raise two grade school age kids largely by myself while working full time, and I was so displeased at my ex for abandoning us most of the time (a foreshadowing of 10 years later when she'd unceremoniously leave me to pursue her career dreams), I loved those kids so much and cherish those memories with them. Sometimes I wake up missing those little people so much. Today was one of those days. And my heart aches a little bit. I'm so grateful my kids are nice adults.

Without going into too much detail, he's grown up in a upper middle class white household that is pretty liberal on most issues so I know it didn't come from either parent.  Long story short, I believe he found his way to various alt-right Youtube personalities like Steven Crowder, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, etc...  My best guess is he went from watching YouTube Video Game videos as a kid and somehow the algorithm decided to start recommending some videos outside of that realm and *poof* we now have a kid who is going down the Intellectual Dark Web path.  (BTW, FUCK you very much, Google and FB!!!!) My question is this:  as a parent, how does one address and combat this effectively?  I can't just tell him 'you're wrong and those guys are full of shit' because that will just reinforce the us-vs-them mentality that those guys perpetuate.  Of course, we are now talking about this as a family and making sure he knows we disagree with those viewpoints.  But it also would be helpful to have some backup.

218,Why are standards so high for children to even START school?!,"My 4 year old had her ""Kindergarten Assessment"" test today, which is an evaluation the school gives to see if they are ready to start kindergarten. This test scored the children on recognizing upper and lowercase letters (by being able to recite them) and if they sang the alphabet song as they went, they were stopped and asked to say the letters, one by one. Counting numbers up to 50. Reciting her name, age, birthday, address, phone number, town, and state. Drawing 10 different shapes. Sorting, grouping, and making patterns. My child scored around 41 out of 100, I was told that 71 was the average and after seeing this test I am livid. Not only are these seriously advanced questions for children who haven't even started school yet, but the way they scored them was worse. They grouped the letters in groups of 5, meaning she had to get all 'abcde' 'fghijk' 'lmnop' etc, and if she missed one letter, she didn't get credit for the rest of the letters in that group. Plus she wasn't aloud to use the alphabet song to help her. She drew her shapes but didn't get credit because ""some didn't have sharp corners"". She spelled out her name but the second letter looked more like an A than an E so didn't get credit. So ultimately the teacher came out and told me that she recommends my daughter NOT start kindergarten next year, but to wait a year and put her in a slower program called ""young 5s"" for kids who have late birthdays and aren't ready for the fast paced learning environment of kindergarten. Technically she qualifies, but her birthday still qualifies her for kindergarten (she turns 5 in 3 weeks) as well and If I hold her back she will be a year behind her age group the rest of her life. She is in preschool two days a week right now. I'm just so frustrated because why do they have to be so advanced to even start school?! I know she knows a lot of the things she didn't get credit for, and heck if we had known what she was going to be tested on I could have taken the time to go over this info with her. I don't want her to be behind, but I don't want her in with other children who are apparently much more advanced than she is and have a hard time.

Counseling, a new school, a bigger house, spending time individually, we eat dinner together, we do things together, there are chores and expectations, and did I mention more counseling? I'm exhausted before the day is even over because it's 50/50 on whether everyone makes it to school and there's at least a 5% chance that I will have to at least consider calling the police.

Moments after it was finished our older daughter sent my wife a message which said: ""What is wrong with you??"" followed by more messages saying that we are disgusting and she doesn't want to talk to us again or never lie down in our bed. My wife made an attempt to talk to her but she refused and kicked her out of the room. We asked her what was so disgusting about this and told her that this is a normal thing for adults to do although we understood that this must feel very uncomfortable for her. Today she does not want to talk to us. Is there something else that we can do to make her feel less uncomfortable about this situation? I want to try talking to her in like a weeks time about sex but am unsure if that is the right thing to do or not. She has a history of being immature when it comes to talking about subjects that are hard to talk about and usually ends up jolting out of the room and refusing to continue talking.

224,My sister noticed that I wasn't in any family photos...,"A few years ago, my sister commented on the fact that I was absent from pictures in family photo albums. ""Well, I'm always taking the picture,"" was my response. But the truth was more complicated. As a young mother, I felt very ugly all of the time. I would go for days without looking in the mirror. I'm a little convinced that this was some sort of a mental health self preservation. When I did look, I didn't like what I saw. I looked frazzled, exhausted and I felt like a mess. Depression was definitely a factor in this, but I was also burnt out and my priority was never self care, it was always about keeping the house together and getting people to where they needed to be on time, prepared for what they needed to do. This isn't a unique phenomenon. The invisible mother who is always taking the picture, never in the picture, is something that a lot of mothers struggle with. Then two years ago, when quarantine started, I suddenly had time to prioritize self care. I did a complete makeover: I shaved the side of my head for a spunky and fun style, died my hair bright colors, invested in a skin care regiment and really put the effort into myself. And I have to say, I really like my smile. The more I looked at myself, the more I was able to appreciate how I saw myself. It has really made a difference. Now that we are back in full swing (everyone in school, work, busy busy busy), I have maintained my self care regiment, setting boundaries when necessary to have time to prioritize myself. I am constantly taking selfies with my family and friends now. Our family photo albums have me in them again and it feels really good.",,False,False,parenting

230,Completely Heartbroken,"TW: infant death, blood, surgery, placenta previa, vasa previa I‚Äôm having a hard time and feel the need to share what happened to me. When I did my second ultrasound the doctor told me I had a low lying placenta (placenta previa) and so I was going to have to do an ultrasound farther along in my pregnancy to make sure that my placenta moved up (in most cases it does). After my third ultrasound my OBGYN confirmed that my placenta moved up and I was good to have a natural labour. I was really happy because I wanted to experience that and I was terrified of the idea of a c-section. Fast forward to a day before my due date. My fianc√© and I had an amazing day. He surprised me and came home early from work. It was especially exciting because he was taking paternity leave and it was his last day of work. We decided to go for a walk, the sun was out and it was just a beautiful evening. We saw parents with babies and children and talked about how excited we were for our baby to come. We got home and watched shows. I felt like I was floating, just so excited for what life was going to be like. After we got back home, we settled into bed and put on a show to watch. Before my fianc√© fell asleep, I remember telling him I think the baby was coming soon. I just didn‚Äôt realize how soon. I was beginning to fall asleep when suddenly I felt warm liquid coming out of my vagina. I was confused at first and then pulled the blanket off and noticed it was blood. I woke up my fianc√© and jumped out of bed and the blood kept coming and coming. There. Was. So. Much. Blood. I started shaking uncontrollably. I was SO scared. My fianc√© called the ambulance and we were at the hospital within 15 minutes. They took me in right away. They couldn‚Äôt find my baby‚Äôs heartbeat at first which propelled me into a panic. I was still shaking intensely. When they finally found the heartbeat they said it was too slow and they said they were going to have to proceed with an emergency c-section. They quickly moved me into the operating room. I passed by my fianc√© in the hall as they pushed me on the stretcher. We were both so scared. I wish he could have been in the room too. Inside the room, there were like 10 different doctors and nurses. No one was speaking to me they were all just grabbing me and hooking me up to things. Someone kept yelling for a blade and that terrified me even more. I began crying and finally a nurse spoke to me and said that an anesthesiologist was going to put me to sleep now. I woke up and I found out I had a son but he lost so much blood  that they had to do a transfusion. I was also told he had a seizure due to the shock from the surgery. I was told they were going to transfer him to Sick Kids NICU. Hours go by and I still haven‚Äôt even seen my son. All I want to do is hold him. They eventually bring him and he‚Äôs so pale and he‚Äôs hooked up to a million different little wires but he‚Äôs so beautiful and I just want to love him. This moment is brief and they rush him to Sick Kids. I am left at the hospital to recover. My fianc√© and I decide it‚Äôs best that he goes with our son to Sick Kids so he is not alone. At Sick Kids, they explain to my Fianc√© that our son has HIE due to loss of blood and lack of oxygen to his brain. So, the question wasn‚Äôt whether he had brain damage, it was about how severe it was. We were hopeful that he would still be okay. I had many family members who had  babies who had HIE and had no health issues. Ultimately, I would accept and love my baby anyway he was. At Sick Kids, they hooked him up to an EEG to monitor his brain activity and watch for more seizures. Because of his traumatic birth they decided to cool him for days to help with the brain injury. It pains me to think of that first day that my fianc√© had to go to Sick Kids alone and deal with all the doctors and all the anxiety by himself. My fianc√© spent all day with our son until he started to fall asleep and the nurses told him he had to go home. He asked the nurses to call of us if anything happened overnight. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm still at the hospital trying to  focus on healing as quickly as possible so I could be with my family. I finally get to sleep. When I wake up, I call Sick Kids to see how my son did overnight. They inform me that he had another seizure. I completely break down at this point and demand that the nurses do what they can to let me leave so I can be with my son. My fianc√© is furious that they didn‚Äôt call us when it happened. He quickly makes his way over there.",,False,False,parenting
231,I got told to take my baby home last night.,"My MIL is in town for a visit. She‚Äôs awesome and has for the most part, been really great about the limitations that come with having a one year old in tow. Then last night, she decided we should go out for dinner. Our baby goes to bed around 730pm, so I knew we had a small window of time for this venture to be successful. Still, I haven‚Äôt been out in a year either. I was willing to try. We picked a loud chain restaurant and arrived at 615pm. The place was very crowded and it took forever to get seated. Service was also incredibly slow. We had expected this however, and were not bothered. The baby sat in the booth with me and did all the wiggling and loud singing that is normal for that age. Everyone ate. It took a long time, but we managed to enjoy a meal out with no major meltdowns. We exited the restaurant at 830pm. My husband had walked out ahead of me with the baby and I had stayed back to help MIL out. As soon as the baby saw me, she started to cry. I said, ‚ÄúAw, don‚Äôt cry.‚Äù Then a young woman standing next to me said, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want your baby to cry, maybe you should take her home.‚Äù I was with my MIL, so I pretended not to hear and kept walking. I was livid inside though. Is 830pm too late to have my baby out? Was I wrong to bring her to a restaurant? Even if it was wrong and it was too late, what difference does it make to her?

I don't know why I've lost interest in him. I don't know why I'm so frustrated and annoyed by him. I used to think he was the best thing ever, but now I can't wait till bed time and he is leaving me alone. I do my best to make sure he doesn't sense this. I never tell him to not talk or go away or anything like that. I force myself to do one to one activities with him and spend time with him. Even though I find it exhausting. I feel guilt constantly. Why has this happened? Why have my feelings change so quickly? I can spend time effortlessly with my baby but with him it's like pulling teeth. He is a wonderful child, funny, smart and engaging - so why?? Please someone help. Give me some strategies to rebuild the connection and empathy I had for him.

It's just a glorified line, except there's no one in charge, so everyone is just up close, jostling, bumping, and cutting the line. All the families just go in a big circle and there's no time to do anything but shuffle in the line, because if you fall behind, you get replaced. I don't even understand why this so uniformly replaced Trick or treating. You got to go to people's homes (who decorated and wanted you there), take your time, let your kids wander, there was no line to cut... just superior in every way.

There are circumstances where trunk or treating is both positive and necessary. I'm so glad people have the option to take their kids trunk or treating where tick or treating isn't advisable. I'm also glad to know trunk or treating is an available option, but not the preferred norm in many places.

My son is doing well. Once I administered his Epi Pen his symptoms immediately improved. I watched my son all night to make sure he was well. He's back to his wild and giggly self. Many have asked what my relationship is like with my MIL? My husband and I don't have the best relationship with her. We are not close. She is not the easiest person to talk with.

She would call and tell me to keep exposing him to overcome the allergy. This event was another red flag to add to the pile.",,False,False,parenting
245,Does Anybody Else Ask Their Children Permission Before Hugging or Kissing Them?,"It was my wife's idea, but I'm really on board with it and am wondering how others may feel about this. I personally feel like it reinforces the idea that their body is there own and are more likely to speak up and say ""no"" when the aunt with the bad breath demands a kiss on the mouth or the gropey, wierd uncle wants the 100th hug. Luckily, my kids don't have these issues with their current aunts/uncles, but I feel like it's a lesson they can carry through for when they grow up and start seeing people.  They'll both know how to respect their SO's and be comfortable in saying ""no"". Edit: I'm going to clarify a few things because it's astonishing how hateful people are when they disagree with you.  I didn't come here to vilify those that don't ask permission, and frankly I find accusing me of trying to be ""woke"" or an ""SJW"" is just a lazy and un-clever way of saying you disagree.  I purposely flaired this thread as ""discussion"" as I was genuinely interested in seeing how other parents felt about this. No, I don't ask for permission every single time as I do acknowledge nonverbal cues, context, and implied consent plays a large part in interpersonal relationship.  I do, however, find that asking reinforces the idea of consent even when it can be taught in other ways.  I'm speaking from a personal perspective here having experienced it as a child.  Luckily, I grew up not being traumatized by it, but that doesn't mean every children will just because I did.  It would be naive and quite arrogant of you to claim the size fits all scenario just because it worked for you. I'm particularly disappointed with one person claiming it's ok for him not to ask his wife and kids because he doesn't need to ask his dog for pats... Edit 2:  Apparently I'm a political lunatic now?  I'm not sure if this is hilarious or sad that someone would equate the importance of teaching consent with a political affiliation/narrative. I'm still waiting on the ""so"" clever response of, ""Tell us you're not a parent by telling us you're not a parent""... On that note, let me reiterate that I don't feel there's necessarily a right or wrong answer here.  Every child is different as is every parent and I will say in earnest that if you parent with a genuine sense of having your child's best interest at heart, you are doing a phenomenal job. One person pointed out that it's important to also teach your child about consent and not just body autonomy, and I am 100% on board with that.  I do acknowledge that all of this can be done without the asking permission aspect, but don't act like I'm being harmful when I'm adding another layer of respect with my children and wife alike. ...And thank you for my first silver and hugz.",,False,False,parenting
246,Does anyone else dislike their friends children?,"Y‚Äôall. When we have kids, I feel like we develop a level of empathy for all children and parents that makes us a lot more understanding. But. This weekend our friends came over and they have a daughter who I can say I am not the biggest fan of. She went into my kids playroom and was literally just dumping everything out just to dump it out. And not even just in a pile to find a toy. She literally just was doing it to make a giant mess. Also she is super destructive and is super rough, just breaking shit left and right. They were here 3 hours and by the time they left, my sons fire truck was disassembled with the hose ripped off, the kitchen oven handle was ripped off, and so many other toys just missing parts. She also is the kid who goes through all your stuff. Excuse me ma‚Äôam but all the toys are downstairs. You have no reason to be in my office going through my papers! And if I tell you not to go upstairs, don‚Äôt talk back to me. Additionally, as a house guest she is super demanding. Asking for something to drink - tell her the options and say no to everything. Sorry I don‚Äôt have your specific kind of soda you like‚Ä¶ at dinner she sat over the bowl of French fries shoveling them in her mouth like a maniac instead of putting them on her plate to be ‚Äúfunny.‚Äù She‚Äôs 7 by the way. And I adore her parents. They are really trying their best. But she has a younger brother who is a lot of work as well. They try and tell her no and to listen and not be so demanding but she‚Äôs just a huge brat. She‚Äôs just a very difficult child.

My kids have enough toys to stock an entire toys r us, so clothes are the preferred gift. Well, I said 24 months or 2T. My husband's aunt thought those looked awfully big so she bought 18 months instead. 18 months fit, but only just. Which means, she'll outgrow them in a month. I prefer to get new clothes slightly big to give them room to grow and get your money's worth. Aunt saved the receipt so we can exchange them.

251,"On the topic of ""Stranger Danger""","...and other iterations of unknown equals bad, don't talk to strangers, etc. This is not a new idea but I haven't seen it on this sub lately and imo it always bears repeating. The concept of stranger danger as general advice is both antiquated and harmful, especially for children. It creates the idea that most people are ""bad"" or intend harm to others, which I do not believe to be true. It lays a foundation of mistrust, suspicion and fear. It's difficult to unravel or alter once it's set and creates an easy path for anxiety, paranoia, and hatred to enter. The real harm almost always comes from faces we already know. They are not strangers; they are uncles and politicians and priests and neighbors. We talk to our children about ""tricky people."" Tricky people can be any size, shape, color or age. Tricky people can be friendly, handsome and kind. Tricky people can wear uniforms. Tricky people are unlikely to act tricky ALL the time. We might see a tricky person a hundred times before they attempt shenanigans. Luckily there are ways to spot them! A tricky person might ask a child for help instead of another adult. A tricky person might try to get you alone. A tricky person may try to convince you it's okay to break the rules. A tricky person may tell you to keep secrets (our family has ""surprises"" instead, which are secrets meant to be shared later). If an adult or older child (or anyone really) is behaving in a way that causes discomfort or unease then you might have yourself a tricky person, folks! Get out of there quickly and go tell your safe adult all about it. In cases of emergency or separation, we advise our children to stay where there are (if it's safe to do so) and look for a family. Look for children that are with their mommy and daddy; ask that/those parent(s) for help. Teach your children the correct names for their own bodily anatomy. It's hilarious to hear a 3-year-old shout ""MOM, come wipe my ANUS!"" Teach them your name and phone number as soon they are old enough. Love them and let them love too! Strangers are almost never dangerous. Watch out for the tricky people. Edit: I fear I've been unclear. Tricky people can certainly be strangers! It's my understanding, statistically speaking, that most strangers are not tricky people AND most tricky people are not strangers BUT there is absolutely crossover there, of course! I try not to speak in absolutes as there are almost always outliers.",,False,False,parenting

No improvement from the meds. We were pushing fluids of course. She woke us up at 4am. Dizzy and thirsty and burning up. Wife took her a second hospital this morning. She now had pneumonia in both lungs on top of covid. They are sending her and admitting her to a third hospital that better treats pediatrics. Apparently then first hospital never did a chest x-ray. They may have picked it up. Talked to my baby on the phone. She's terrified but trying to stay strong. She held back tears afraid ""Daddy, I'm scared and I want to come home and see you.""

Switch out between Tylenol and ibuprofen every 3 hours until the fever breaks. Did that last night and through the day. Her fever seems to be broke, but just struggling with the pneumonia.

We baked today so I scrolled through all my recordings, there's one titled Blue's Baking Show and I got excited and we watched- and then I bawled like a little baby. I'm half Filipino and white. I grew up knowing it's just life not hearing anything about my Filipino culture while I watch t.v. It's just life, you move on and it's fine, I get it, we're a minority, you find your people and connect culturally that way and my dad being in the Navy, we got that connection or you go to the Philippines for two weeks every 5-10 years and connect that way.

257,How do I kindly tell my husband he is a sh!t parent?,"I was going to post this is r/relationships but I didnt want a bunch of Gen-Z kids telling me to divorce my husband and go to therapy. So here I am. I (26f) dont want to argue or fight with him (29m). I intend on sitting down and having a very diplomatic conversation with him about this but I just don't know what to say or how to word it without sounding harsh, rude or like I'm accusing him of being a bad parent - even though I am. I want to be polite when this conversation takes place. Basically, he does look after the kids but he needs to be told EXACTLY what to do - which is fine, I'm used to it now. Today he wanted to play ps5 with a bunch of friends online so he did the smart and thoughtful thing and asked me what time our son (2) would be asleep by so he could log on without being disturbed. I told him it would be 9:30pm but if he isn't asleep by then, I'm more than happy to tend to him on my own. Surprise surprise, the kid was still wide awake but I dealt with it and he was asleep by 10 and my husband was not disturbed. We have a 2 month old who I bathed and breastfed ready for bed at 8pm as normal. He has a habit of being swaddled tightly (important to the story) and we do this every day so he can have a nice long sleep from 8pm until his next feed (around 12am). My husband kindly keeps him next to him while he's sleeping during these 4 hours. He's usually playing ps5 and I'm in the same room browsing the Web or watching a TV show. My husband went down with him at 8pm and I stayed up with the toddler. At 10pm, I went downstairs to check on our baby and he was still awake, he wasn't swaddled, he had crazy eyebags, red eyes and he his nappy SERIOUSLY needed changing. He didnt even have a blanket on him and the room was freezing. My husband was rocking his bouncer lightly with one foot while playing his games. I took one look at the kid and got really really mad. WHY didn't he put the baby before his stupid game??? The baby needed tending to and he ignored everything and just hopped right onto the ps5. I dont want to sound like I'm nagging but jeez, put the baby first and you can play all night if you want to. We do this EVERY night. The one night I'm busy with the toddler, my poor 2 month old baby is neglected. I was so mad, I just took the baby upstairs and sorted him out and put him to sleep. I didnt bother saying anything to my husband because I know he won't focus while he's playing so he's a lost cause right now. Any advice is welcome. Ideally from other parents who have experienced this sort of thing with their significant other. Thank you.

258,Please teach your kids about coping with emotions,"I am a parent of 2 kids (5 and 8) and also a Kindergarten teacher. This post is not for parents of children with exceptional needs which require different responses. One thing I'm noticing is what must be a social media movement. There are now more kids than ever that can correctly label their emotions which is awesome! They will say things like, ""I feel sad that I lost the game."" The problem is I think part of this movement is to name emotions and recognize that emotions are ok to feel, which is true, but that also needs to be backed up with a coping piece! There are a record number of kids that label their emotions as they break down into complete meltdowns when they lose, someone looks at them the wrong way, they are doing something new, they don't like their snack, etc. Your kids are going to be adults and you need to prepare them for that. If you wouldn't expect a 10 year old to roll around on the floor having a meltdown because someone is playing with a toy that they like then don't tell your child that that behaviour is ok because they feel sad. Tantrums and crying do not feel good, they alienate your children from their peers and they are not the best mechanism for dealing with big emotions. Counting to 10, belly breathing, yoga exercises, walking away, seeking some alone time, playing with a fidget, etc. are just some of the many socially acceptable ways to deal with big emotions. I think Covid also plays a role here and all of us with kids in Kindergarten down need to really work on improving our children's social skills. Kids don't like to play with kids that have unpredictable meltdowns or whine and complain about everything. It is good to feel emotions but it is better to have strategies to keep them from ruling your life. And if anyone knows if there is a Youtube channel/video that might be leading to this please let me know it is just so bizarre that there are so many kids using exactly the same language and acting in such similar ways this year.",,False,False,parenting

The traditional latchkey kids of the ‚Äò80s - those children who came home to an empty house and had more free reign than ever before- they were a product of their time. They watched TV, played Nintendo, ate Gushers to their heart‚Äôs content. Then their parents came home, and order was restored.¬† Hindsight would prove this overabundance of freedom created its own parenting backlash years later‚Äî those latchkey kids became helicopter parents.¬† Their overcompensation was to never let their own children out of their sight.

Two years ago,I was an involved parent.¬† My children went to school and daycare. They came home to a grandparent and did their homework. They played with friends‚Äîunder supervision, of course.¬† We did playdates and craft projects together. I loved parenting.¬† I loved parenting because I knew my limitations. Before we had kids, my husband and I agreed I was not ‚Äústay-at-home mom‚Äù material.¬† I love to work; I find fulfillment in my work. I love quiet time and alone time.

265,UPDATE: Furious With My Daughter's New teacher!,"Original post here! First of all, I just want to say a massive thank you to all of the support that I got on my original post. Thank you for all of the advice, and the sympathies, and the love for my little girl. I really appreciate all of that. And especially thank you to all of the people that said I was doing a good job by my daughter, that was very encouraging to hear and I don't often hear things like that! So thank you! I want to just clear a couple of things up from the original post before I give my update. I got an overwhelming number of replies and it was near impossible to reply to everyone, but there were a few things that I noticed kept being mentioned in comments and I didn't have the energy to keep repeating myself over and over again. Unfortunately, having her moved into a different classroom with a different teacher isn't an option. Her school is small and only has one class per year group, so this teacher is the only option unless they swap in another teacher from another year group but I find that unlikely. It would be a case of switching schools but that also comes with complications of catchment areas, accessibility, and finding a place for both my five year old daughter and my seven year old daughter. For those who aren't from the UK: a head teacher/head master is the equivalent of a principal and is in charge of the running of the school, and that is who I had the meeting with. They wear a uniform, which her cardigan is a part of. Kids are required to wear either a sweatshirt or a cardigan with the school logo. It's not and never has been school policy to ask to take your cardigan off. This teacher is new to my daughter's school this year. I wasn't sure if he had taught before this and neither were other parents that I had asked. From my meeting today, I have been told that he has taught before but usually teaches older children such as Year 5 and Year 6. I see people commenting saying that they would have barged in and ""smacked the teacher"", or that they would have ""gave him a piece of their mind"", or that I should have. I wanted to, believe you me, I really wanted to... but I also know that in doing so that then I would make myself the problem in this situation, and then my initial points don't really hold much merit. Being difficult with the school means that I'll only get the same response, and would be seen as the difficult parent. I don't want my daughter's case to be dismissed because of my behaviour. I have to play the system, effectively. The last point that I wanted to clear up is for the numerous teachers that commented on my post. I don't hate teachers and I don't view it as a parent vs teacher confrontation. I have never had an issue with how my children have been taught or treated at that school before, and am well aware that there are some fantastic, amazing teachers out there that are so impactful on children. I take issue with this particular teacher and how my daughter has been treated. I've only ever had an issue once prior to this where my seven year old daughter was called some names by other kids, and her teacher solved the problem immediately. This isn't a dig at teachers as a whole, it's an issue with this one specific teacher. So, the update. After reading the comments about looking out for a UTI, I informed her father (he has custody over the weekend) and asked him to look out for the symptoms. She had another little accident on Friday night and wet the bed, and complained over the weekend that it hurt to wee with a frequent and urgent need to go so I called the doctors up early this morning and scheduled an appointment. She did a sample and the doctor prescribed some medication for her so hopefully things clear up. I didn't send her to school today because her doctor's appointment was at an inconvenient time and she would have only been there for a couple of hours. Although, I did have to take her with me in the morning as I didn't have alternative childcare but I didn't put her in her uniform to make a point. The new head teacher was nice and I think the meeting went well. I explained the situation to her, including everything that my daughter had told me, what I had heard from other parents, the attitude that this teacher took with me and just my general concerns for all of the children in that class but most specifically my daughter. I would like to say that I was somewhat calm and collected; I was still angry at what had happened but this head teacher seemed to be understanding and willing to listen to what I had to say. And she made several notes. She confirmed with me that the rule about having to ask for permission to take your sweatshirt/cardigan off is not school policy and the teacher will be asked to revise that. She also said that asking for permission to go to the toilet is school policy and encouraged as it's in place to safeguard the child - i.e. accounting for where children are in general and during times of an emergency. Completely understandable, and I echoed that I encourage her to ask for permission. However, I take issue in her not being allowed to go, especially when she had asked multiple times. I also found out later from my ex partner that my daughter was physically holding herself to stop herself from weeing by the third time she asked, and made the point that it should have been very obvious at that point that she needed to go. At this point, my daughter hadn't seen the doctor and I explained that I was concerned that she had a UTI. I then brought about my concerns for this man to properly safeguard and care for my child whilst she's under his care. As well as my concerns that he's already labelled her as a troublemaker/problem child and that attitude is going to lead to more instances throughout the year.",,False,False,parenting

He was using the iPad to play some games and I had to download a big file for work so things got slowish for a minute. I explained to him that we didn‚Äôt have WiFi when I was a kid - nobody did. Thankfully we had a computer and an internet connection before most households because of my dad‚Äôs job‚Ä¶ but still.

He said ‚Äúoh, it couldn‚Äôt be THAT bad.‚Äù I found a dial up sound on YouTube YouTube Dial Up Connection Sound. It didn‚Äôt even get to the end before he was squealing for me to ‚Äúplease make the terrible noise stop.‚Äù Then I finally answered his question.

267,Is my 5 year old out of line or is our Dentist?,"My 5 year old daughter went to the dentist today. I've gone to this dentist for about ten years and have always been happy with her. I've referred several friends and family to her practice. She used to have another dentist in her office that took most of the children appointments and he was always great with my kids. He moved away though and my kids have seen her for the past year or so. My daughter has always been very fearful at the dentist. She doesn't have special needs but she's never liked to be touched, and has always hated hygienists or doctors putting their hands in her mouth. She doesn't bite (though she did as a small toddler) but will thrash her head, refuse to open, and cry, sometimes inconsolably. Today didn't start too bad - my daughter had questions about some of the tools and told the hygienist right away that she ""hates the taste of the rubber gloves"" when they stick their fingers in her mouth. She was afraid she was going to fall off the chair when they put the back down low and was holding my hands. It took a few tries to get her to open her mouth so they could count her teeth, and then she was very resistant to letting them polish. But, it was done within ten minutes. My daughter was getting really overwhelmed at this point and started crying. The hygienist suggested skipping x rays since she could tell my daughter wasn't having it. I told my daughter the doctor just needed to look over her teeth and we'd be done. The dentist, Dr. G, came in and my daughter was still crying hard. Dr. G immediately sat and held my daughter's shoulders down, saying very close to her face in a loud voice, ""The only reason to cry is when something is hurting you and we're not hurting you. You are getting too old for this. You are going to sit quietly, stop crying, and open your mouth. If you don't I'm going to make your mother leave the room."" Then she said ""I'm going to wait until you calm down"". I was trying to soothe my daughter but the angry face and harsh words really made her lose it. She was gagging and coughing from crying so hard. Dr. G waited all of about one minute and said ""We'll try this another day Mom"" and walked out without looking at me. Even the staff didn't seem to look at me as I walked my daughter out. I got the distinct feeling they felt my daughter's behavior was out of line. I don't think my daughter is acting spoiled or malicious, I think she's just terrified. Is 5 too old for a child to be resisting at a dentist? Or is my gut feeling that this kind of bedside manner with a scared young kid inappropriate? Any advice on helping my daughter with feeling more comfortable is also appreciated! She's good about letting me brush at home and has gotten good reports on the condition of her teeth, I just want to help her not be so scared.",,False,False,parenting
268,Sudden non-binary,"I (more correctly we) really don't know what to do. Our 13 year old daughter has recently come out as non-binary. Neither of us have anything against that, we have a mixture of non-binary and trans people in our life.  All my child's old feminine clothing has gone to a younger kid that is trans. The issue, for us, is that we actually don't know what the right thing is to do for our child. Until early this year there was never a question of gender.  In fact if you could think of an old gender stereotype they fit it, Disney all the way, musical theatre, anti-physical, high pitched squeally, highly maternal etc.  Never any interests in altered clothing or appearance. Puberty, high school and covid have been a lot.  A few people in her friend group came out as trans or non binary in a very rapid period. Apparently they discussed feelings that had, mostly along the lines of anxiety, non feeling like they belonged and that resonated with our child, and so the journey commenced. Fast forward a bit and whilst they've had a few casual discussions with me in the background they've changed their name at school and with friends (don't get me started on the school emailing teachers about name and pronoun change without even mentioning it to us). Any how now we don't know what to do.  They are seeking our support to get their name and pronouns changed on the roll as they head into senior years, pretty much cementing it for the next 4 years. Conventional wisdom is to just go with it, but we're actually not sure that is the right thing to do for them.  There has been no actual mature thought here, all guidance was from peer age to this point.  Their feelings are real, but I've set them a challenge to say what they believe gender is, what female and male mean to them and what, if any, aspects they don't identify with.  It's been a few weeks now and they don't have a view.  It bothers me a little that they've taken such strong steps to alter everything based on gender identity but panic because they don't know yet what gender is. In all conversations it seems like it's the words (name, pronouns) that they react to not what they mean. It's super weird.",,False,False,parenting

And when I would think of my future wedding, I reveled in the idea that no children would be allowed anywhere near it ever. It ended up being a non-issue, because I got married in the Caribbean, and we only had 6 guests anyways. Fast forward to yesterday, and the groom for the wedding we RSVP'd to informed us that children are not permitted except for his two nieces. And I'M MAD ABOUT IT! Not because he wants a childless wedding, but more because the invitation said nothing of the sort, and the RSVP even had a kids meal option, which led us to believe that kids were welcome! I probably wouldn't be so mad but this person is a flaky, fairweather friend at best so it's just another feather in his cap of irritating me.

273,Being a parent has made me more pro abortion rights,"I remember chatting to a friend from Ireland a couple of years ago just prior to the abortion referendum campaign who was anti abortion on principle. At one point he made the classic argument of ‚Äúyou‚Äôd have a different perspective if you were a parent‚Äù Well we had a child and he was right, but not in the way he thought. Having my first child made me more pro abortion rights than I was before. Now we‚Äôve had a second child, and that certainty has only increased. Watching my wife breast feed that wonderful, totally loved child at 6am, and actually looking forward to getting our other child ready for the day in an hour and a half, had just brought this to mind. There is so much money, effort, sacrifice and strength needed to raise children. How could anyone force a woman to go through not only the body altering and life threatening journey to full term but also everything else they need to do to raise a child when there‚Äôs a safe, humane alternative?

He started speaking with the family more (once the screen-withdrawal meltdowns ended), acquired more vocabulary through increased interaction, found books more interesting than he used to, and does a lot more play. It‚Äôs common sense really. Experts here say 30 minutes is the maximum screen time kids should be allowed. It‚Äôs so short that no screen time makes no difference to us.

276,Why are activities for young kids scheduled with stay-at-home moms in mind?,"I'm a working mom and I just want to take my kid to a library story time some time. But it's always 10AM on Tuesdays.

I do find some things during evenings and weekends but the options are super limited so we do what we can... It just adds to the mom guilt that I'm not able to do things like library story time with my littles. EDIT: Lots of feedback so I guess I have to clarify a couple things I do understand librarians and other workers want to be done at 5 too. I think some would stay till 6 if paid a bit extra and also, even something at 4:30 I could leave a bit early and do once a week or so. And It's kind of irrelevant how much stimulation my kids are getting with other people while I'm at work. I like to make memories and do things with my kids also. I'm not at all saying they shouldn't have activities for SAH parents and caregivers (and this post wasn't meant to single them out) but that we need more options for non-SAH parents. EDIT 2: Lots of judgment on my parenting. Trust me that I know my kids' personalities and interests well enough to only sign them up for things they'll enjoy and not be overstimulated by. I sign my daughter up for more than my son because that's just their personalities but we have a firm limit of what we will do outside the home each week. Yes, I do enjoy doing things with them. But I would never put my desire to go out and do things over my children's wellbeing. I also spend plenty of time at home with them. I'm not looking to fill every second of every day!!

He just recently got a new girlfriend and they've moved very quickly. I don't particularly want her around my child this early (a revolving door of adults in her life seems harmful) but that's not my choice and I've mostly stayed out of it. Until recently. A few months ago DD (who wasn't even 2 at the time) wasn't listening after coming back from her dad's and I was a little fed up and scolded her in a normal but slightly frustrated tone. DD starts crying, covers her bottom, and says ""no pow pow"".

No. Turns out that ""they've"" decided that that's what they're going to use and now DD gets ""pow pows"" when she doesn't behave. I'm totally at a loss. I've sent over so much research on how spanking isn't effective, talked to them so many times, and they're just digging their heels in.

I'm all about the gentle parenting, not yelling, not spanking, natural consequences, all that. DD doesn't listen to me now, though, because my natural consequences are nowhere near as scary as spanking so I'm now the pushover parent.

Even though we are paying the nanny to work five days a week, my wife occasionally has a day off or half-day, and will let the nanny go home early or take that day off.

286,Is this ever an appropriate way to speak to your child?,"My husband has had problems in the past with his temper but it has been a long time since he did something really out of line. I really am not sure what exactly transpired yesterday but from what I gathered- our 6 year old was outside putting (in my husbands words) dirt all over his (my sons) ipod he just recently got for his birthday. I think my husband told him to stop, maybe also come inside. My son supposedly ignored him which set my husband off. He took the ipod and came inside and slammed the door, and came upstairs to tell me what transpired. I got up to help the situation and he got in my face and told me he was teaching him a lesson. He said he locked him out of the house. I opened up our cameras outside and saw him running to the back of the house to get in, my husband met him down there and calmly told him ""no, I've had enough with this. I think it's time for you to go. You don't like me and this is what is happening now. Yes. It's time for you to go and find a new house to live in."" and put him back outside, shut and locked that door. Then as our son banged on the door my husband stared at me to not unlock and open it. I watched our son go sit in the middle of the backyard for about 20 seconds before he got upset and ran off. I went and got him, had to chase him down the street. My son was mad at first then started crying and saying he doesn't want to live anymore. I managed to calm him down and took a ride with him to distract and make him feel better. I told him I wasn't going to let dad be mean to him. I haven't heard anything from my husband, no apology to anyone. I have dealt with so much gaslighting from him that it's taken me awhile to find my voice and realize when things are NOT okay. In your opinion, is what he did ""okay"" ??",,False,False,parenting
287,I don't enjoy being a Father.,"I'm writing this because I just don't know what to do anymore. My daughter is such hard work I feel like locking myself in the toilet and crying. She has made me cry a couple of times in her short spell on earth. She was unplanned. My GF was 30 to my 27 at the time of conception, my GF is from an Irish Catholic family so Abortion was never even considered. My GF had a horrendous pregnancy and was so sick every day. She couldn't even drink water without throwing up, it was bad. The day she was born I cried as she was given to me but as I got home I felt a sense of dread. I've never had much confidence in myself and I didn't have a clue what to do. She had colic almost straight away and would cry none stop for hours. We got her into a little routine. Then Covid hit. For 7 months it was just her me and my GF. No one else held her. And as I worked upstairs she seemed to only want her mother. That's now still the case. She has the worst separation anxiety from her mother. She cries if she's not two feet away. We put her into Nursery twice a week and she loves it once she's there. But every day is a battle. With me, she likes to include me sometimes but the majority of the time, I walk into a room and she says ""no Dadda go"" or when its bed time it's only her mother who can put her to bed. It's like she hates me sometimes. My poor GF is so drained and tries to include me but the baby cries until she's sick. I feel lost and lonely and confused. I never thought having a child would be easy but to be this difficult. My favourite part of the day is when it's time to go to bed so I can lie in the darkness and fantasie about something else. Then my daughter will have a nightmare which is 3-4 times a week and we have to spend the next hour trying to console her. Shes a lot better with people now, a little shy but comes around. She shows no signs of Autism but some behaviour issues but is that normal for her age I do love her by the way I really really do. But I just feel so down and sad about it. I'm wishing my life away and I don't know how to make it better. Edit. I'm overwhelmed by the responses to this. And I appreciate your kind words and advice. I'm sorry if I don't respond to you directly but just know I've read your post and thank you for it.",,False,False,parenting

They are expecting their third any day now. We have been on stand-by to take their daughters in the event that the baby arrives sooner than January 3rd, until one of the sets of grandparents can arrive to take over (about a 6 hour drive for either set). Last night, contractions started getting serious, so they dropped the girls with us and went to the hospital. It was about an hour before our normal dinner time, so we started getting them prepped to eat with us. Perspective is everything. By the time they were done it looked like a bomb of food had gone off. I'm not used to that kind of mayhem at the dinner table (or breakfast). Their mom warned us that they were very difficult at mealtime. I was not prepared for what that meant. I will never complain about my kids at the table again.

I posted because I had no idea what I was doing and nowhere else left to turn I was in a dark dark place. 6 months later I've booked a day off work to take my beautiful daughter to the farm to feed the baby lambs. The tantrums that she used to have while getting dressed have now stopped except the odd one maybe on nursery day. When Mummy goes to work now she excitedly tells me it's Daddy daughter day. My morning now consists of breakfast, playing hide and seek, chase and lots of tickles and of course football and this is all before 8am. The difference is remarkable and I'm so glad I didn't give up and I was close to believe me. Is she perfect? No, we still have tantrums and tears but they're manageable. The threat of the naughty step means she apologises and we move on. Am I perfect? No, far far from it. I'm learning still every day but now I don't take it personally, I think I talk calmly and we resolve it together. During teeth cleaning today, we were smiling in the mirror, I was kissing her cheek whilst she giggled. I looked her straight into her bright green eyes and smiled at her. She looked back and said. ""I love you Daddy"" It made me tear up as I hugged her tightly and said I love you to baby. Hang in there.

She made him get rid of all his friends ""because they only need each other"", give her all his passwords, and lied to him all the time. He is the sweetest, best kid ever. AND HE FINALLY HAD ENOUGH! My husband and I have been distraught over this. We have been constantly worried, bickering with each other about it, and I knew if we just let him know we cared and we were worried, but didn't push, he would come to this on his own AND HE DID! I am so happy and I just wanted to share with all of you fine folks that time takes time, things will turn out right in the end, and people - even kids - should be allowed (within reason) to make their own mistakes. She is gone and my son is smiling again. He is playing with his brother and watching movies with us. He came on a hike with us and he laughed and smiled like he has not in over a year. I am elated. ETA: He has been in therapy for awhile as his bio father was very abusive. I believe he was/is suffering from a form of survivor's syndrome; repeating and replaying the same relationship over again to try to make it come out right this time. I am gently suggesting he get back in touch with his therapist - his ex wouldn't let him go because the therapist was a woman.... a 55 year old woman with grown children and a happy marriage, so obviously a cougar looking for a teenage boy to sleep with. /s I also did speak with him about it periodically throughout the year, as no one said anything to me when I started dating my abuser. So I did bring it up and I let him know my thoughts (reasonably) and that I was concerned. EDIT 2: thank you for all your kind words and encouragement! I have read every single comment and taken them to heart. It's only been a couple of days, but things are looking good. We do have him set up with a friend who works in ""concierge mental health"" to have a family education session.

He's currently restricted to going out, as a few days ago, he decided to stay out too late with this girl. I suspected he may have had a bit of alcohol. Now, she's been coming back from school with him, despite her not living around here. Anyway, she came to the door. He expected her to be coming and going to his room. I said no and he ranted at me, then stormed out of the front door with her. I sent him a text telling him to get back home or there's trouble. He sent me a text reply saying I don't like her and if I don't accept her, he will live with her and more rant. Just being a pain. How do I stop him from hanging out with her? I don't like his other friends either, but she is openly disrespectful and rude. His behaviour is bad when she's about. Edit:  They came in about a week ago with chippy food. I asked her to remove  her shoes, so she took them off and threw them across the room. They sat  on the sofa, then I gave them plates for their food. She told me to  fuck off. My son thought it was very funny. I talk to her, I say that  she's in my house and needs to respect the rules, which means using  plates for her food.

303,Cruelty in my boys‚Äô friend resulting in my anger at an entire family,"TL;DR: oldest son‚Äôs friend told my youngest son to slap himself/punch himself in the privates repeatedly or he would destroy his drawing. I have two boys, ages 6 and 7.5. They have a friend down the street the same age as my older son. He‚Äôs shown some weird behavior in the past before he was pulled out to be homeschooled (he wiped his own feces on my son in the school restroom and tried to coerce him not to tell). That was two years ago. I wanted to sever ties with the friendship then, but we pushed through assuming this might be some weird behavioral blip. Last night both boys were playing at his house while my wife and I packed for an upcoming trip. The mother was there but was understandably busy with their baby; so the older daughter (maybe 10/11 years old) was ‚Äúin charge‚Äù. When I arrived to pick them up the mom told me there was  a little bit of an issue towards the end of the visit. After a few awkward moments of fact-finding, it was said that my youngest had exhibited some behavioral issues. I‚Äôm not naive to the fact that my kids can step out of line on occasion. Thankfully he addressed this directly and in front of the others (which isn‚Äôt typical for him as he is very shy) telling me what had happened. The boys had spent some time drawing spaceships. My son‚Äôs friend had held my youngest‚Äôs drawing up and threatened to tear it unless he slapped himself. Which he did. The boy told him to progressively slap himself harder. Eventually he stopped, but then told him he must hit himself in the privates. My son refused and the boy began tearing his creation so he obliged. The whole time my son is telling me (and the room) this, the other boy keeps repeating things like ‚Äúno, I didn‚Äôt‚Äù and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not true‚Äù. I asked my oldest, who was in the room with them, for his take. He corroborated my youngest‚Äôs account (which was quite difficult for him I‚Äôm sure as he is highly agreeable towards friends). The mom says there will be a conversation when we leave. As we leave, I‚Äôm so pissed and taken aback that I don‚Äôt exactly know how to proceed. As soon as we get outside my youngest is in tears. I hug him and tell him it is never ok for someone to treat him that way, that real friends wouldn‚Äôt act in such a way. We talk about it as we walk home. We talked about it more when we got home and told my wife what happened. Within minutes, the other mom texted a voice message apology from the boy as well as letting us know he admitted to the whole thing. My wife is friends with the mom, which made it more awkward. To me, this is a sign akin to a kid hurting an animal; it‚Äôs beyond the average ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not my friend if you don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù which is quite normal in kids. Am I overreacting? My instinct is to eliminate this relationship immediately and foster friendships elsewhere. We‚Äôre not limited in friend availability and I think the risk of a repeat offense outweighs any potential benefit of salvaging a youthful relationship.",,False,False,parenting

I overheard her husband come over and say ‚ÄúDid you bring extra clothes?‚Äù And she responded no and that he would just ride back home in wet clothes. I had just gone to a yard sale that morning and had some boy shorts in my trunk so I went to grab them and offered her two different ones since I didn‚Äôt know her sons size.

311,"Tonight, I'm crushed, Reddit. My teenager daughter dropped the bomb.","Long story short, well over a decade ago my ex-wife and I divorced, it was rough, but somehow although the legal paperwork said otherwise, I ended up with all four of my young kids full time and my ex took off and did her own thing. For years. During that time I sacrificed everything, having four young kids under school age with high demands killed my career instantly, and we scraped by on public assistance for years. I pushed myself through college and deep into student loan debt to provide for them and find a new career that would allow me to be both parents and survive better than government cheese, and I did it, it took me seven years and oof, the money, but I never let my kids feel the absence of the other parent. I was there. I did it all, guys. I went to the activities I could, I skipped classes to see mid-day classroom presentations, they were never want for me to be there for them. First concerts, first fairs, first periods, uncomfortable sex talks, I did both jobs. My ex would pop up on occasion, request more money of my assistance than I could spare just take the kids for weekends occasionally at first, but who am I to deny anything to my kids including their other parent? I forgave past child support collections, I killed off the state continuing to ask for any more, and a few years ago she was able to start doing every other week with the kids. I was still full time on call for everything, still made every dance, every football game, my ex never answered her phone ever for anything, emergencies be damned that was my problem. So it's gone for the last few 5 years or so now. But I was on my own with them for more years than that. Every doctors visit, every dentist cleaning. So tonight when my teenage daughter says she wants to live with her mother full time, I'm dead, Reddit, it's absolutely killing me. I... I get it. I'm the structure, the safety, and that's not what teenage girls want when they stretch their wings. I thought I was doing alright, she's got her own cell phone, total privacy, freedom to go out with her friends, but that's... it's not enough to complete with the ex's house where anything goes, where not even regular bathing has ever been structured. It's a sort of freedom and independence and it hurts to sit here wondering why she feels oppressed when I really have only ever supported her dreams and passions, never pushed her into doing things she didn't want, encouraged her to explore and find her self and joy in the things she loves. I don't think I did anything wrong, I just don't think I did. But if I've ever felt a failure at anything in my life, it's tonight. Edit: Wow. Thank you so much for all the encouraging words and the support, it's overwhelming and I truly appreciate it.

312,Please share your embarrassing middle school memories to help my 6th grader feel better,"My newly minted middle school daughter slipped and fell in front of the entire bus this morning. Poor kid was mortified and ran back to the house refusing to go to school. She was already nervous because she forgot her mask and had to run back home to grab it while the bus waited, so she knew everyone was waiting for her and watching. She‚Äôs always been very sensitive when it comes to embarrassment and shuts down in the moment. Yesterday was her first day of 6th grade and it exhausted her physically and mentally. She went from carefree summer fun with friends to waking up at 5:30am and hauling a 20+lb backpack, laptop, lunchbox up and down 3 flights of stairs for 6 hours (no lockers right now-covid). She came home tired and was crying by dinner time. I helped her get ready for bed, brushed her hair and rubbed her back til she fell asleep. She woke up this morning in a good mood ready to start again and life practically smacked her in the face. She‚Äôs taking a well deserved mental health day today. Please share any embarrassing middle school memories you have so that I can help her see these things happen to everyone but life does go on. Edit Thank you all so much for sharing your experiences! I didn‚Äôt expect such a large response but it is wonderful to see a bunch of internet strangers come together to help her feel better. We have been reading through them and laughed til we cried. She is feeling much more at ease about the whole situation now and realizes it really wasn‚Äôt as big of a deal as she thought it was.",,False,False,parenting
313,Advice: Repeat back things your kids say to you at other times so they know you listen,"My oldest is 9 and starting to want his independence.  Most of his time home is spent in his room or on his Xbox where he plays with his friends (only allowed on weekends and after his chores are done).  Most of our time with him is at daily dinners and car rides because other wise he just wants to be alone in his room (mainly avoiding his younger siblings) and at parties he is with his cousins. My younger two (3m and 6f) are always on top of us and wanting constant attention so I know how he feels as they adore him and want to be with him too. Anyway, after a long day of teaching and constantly having to listen and help my students I would find my tank empty and would listen to my own kids at the end of the day but just reply with ‚Äúhmm, nice, oh, wow‚Äù etc and kind of not being interested.  I heard myself and was like this isn‚Äôt working and feeling all the mom guilt.  But as an introvert it felt impossible to keep up the energy once I was done teaching. One day my oldest called my name and I said ‚Äúwhat‚Äù but in a very bored tone I am sure.  He then, looking dejected, said ‚Äúnever mind‚Äù and shut down.  I felt absolutely horrible and set out to make sure to be more present for my kids even if I didn‚Äôt care or was exhausted, especially right after school when my kids wanted to share about their days with me. Now, when we are around him I will casually bring up what he said earlier in the day or week to his dad or other family to show I heard him. ‚ÄúDid you know [son] is learning about Native Americans at school and he told me (insert fact here)‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat [name friend here] is one of [son] best friends at school and they sit next to each other in class‚Äù or ‚ÄúHey [son] did you and [friends name] make up, I know you guys had a disagreement the other day at school.‚Äù  Or ‚Äúyou guys should hear the funny joke [son] told me the other day.  [Son] do you want to share it or can I?‚Äù   Etc etc.  When I repeat something he told me even a few days or weeks later his face lights up because he knows I care and that He is heard and it really costs me nothing but moments of my time. I know we are exhausted after work and our own stresses,  but just showing our kids we listen to them can make all the difference.",,False,False,parenting
314,Do you ask play date guests to help clean up before they go?,"As a kid, my mom had the expectation that my guests would help clean up any mess we made. By extension, she taught me to clean up at someone else‚Äôs house. If the hosts tell you not to, then that‚Äôs fine but at least offer. I‚Äôve had a foster placement (8G) for 6 months now. With all my placements, I lead with trauma informed parenting and stick to boundaries. One is I do expect her to clean up before she moves to a new activity. She does well with this. Recently, she had a friend over and they had a great time playing outside. They took out balls, bikes, hula hoops, etc. About 10 minutes before the friend‚Äôs mom was to arrive, I asked them to please clean up. The guest refused. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do, so I made it a game with my foster daughter to see which one of us could clean up the fastest. Friend sat on the steps. When friend‚Äôs mom came, I didn‚Äôt plan on saying anything but the friend brought it up. The mom gave me a weird look but didn‚Äôt say anything. My husband thinks it wasn‚Äôt appropriate for me to ask and I should‚Äôve waited until the friend left, then helped  clean. How do you handle it?",,False,False,parenting
315,"Willow, Fey Witch of the Wood: Or, I took my 16Month Daughter Hike-Camping","Yo.  Yooooooooo.  This was wild. So she has always seemed to be really brave- but what toddler isn't?  They all push boundaries, clime dangerously on chairs, triple summersault off couches, run too fast for their little legs. But this was some next level shit.  I was expecting some hesitancy, but nope.  Over felled trees, boulders, streams- nothing slowed her down.  I thought at least nap time/sleep time would be a fun challenge, she has never slept anywhere but her crib and her cot at daycare... But nope, kiddo was out like a light, 1-2 hour nap each day, 8 full hours of sleep each night. One harrowing exp. was the lake.  I thought she might get her feet wet, I did not expect her to dunk her own head under and attempt to ""swim"" (re: slap the water violently with her head dangerously underwater(obviously I had my hands under her in a flash)).  She would not leave the rocky shore of the lake for 3 hours, and kept trying to go back in. At night by the fire she sat cross legged in the adult camp chair I brought for myself (with me sitting on ground next to her, she likes feeling grown up and sitting in the chair alone, it is cute, but I miss cuddles already lol).  She stared at the fire for over an hour just going ""ooooooooh"" every few minutes.  Never tried to approach it or play with it. She's too young for marshmallows(too dangerous as Heimlich Maneuver cannot dislodge them), but next year she will try s'mores. She was go-go-go, she ate 1/2 of her meals while walking and pointing at birds and sticks and bugs.  I was really proud of how well she did with the camp-meals.  She is used to some boujee-ass food, but we were working with my small butane burner and a lot of potentially boring food.  She was a champ. I have never been run as ragged as this, but also never been so revitalized. Following her through the woods for 12 hours a day and making sure she did not kill herself was a challenge to be sure! But she was making herself a crown of moss and eating bugs and throwing rocks further than she's ever thrown before.  I love the outdoors and to see her thrive like this was a dream come true.   She led the way in all our adventures, bravely venturing through field and stream and I am so blindingly thankful for her health and spirit and fire. I am fairly certain I am raising a wood, or possibly swamp, witch. Fairly certain some of her balling was actually spell casting.  She seemed so in-tune with nature, like she was talking to the spirit of the forest. I could not be more proud.",,False,False,parenting

320,Husband wont let me formula feed our child,"So I have a 16 months old son who I exclusively breastfed until 5 months before I started purees. Little back story, I struggled so much to produce enough milk no matter how much I tried to take foods that I was told helped with milk production. Despite that I continued breastfeeding but by 4 months he really wasn't getting much and was bigger so I started introducing purees. Breastfeeding was really tough on me and I never enjoyed it because I was mostly worried my child wasn't getting enough, which is true anyway because he wasn't really gaining weight so well. Now I'm pregnant again and I've let my husband know that I'd like to substitute both breastmilk and formula with this new baby, I really can't have another child fully depend on me again, I got sick from all the stress last time and even got admitted to the hospital. It has become a source of constant argument because my husband insists formula has chemicals and he wants his child to get breastmilk, I have explained the baby will still get breastmilk just not exclusively. He's now guilt tripping me and making me feel like a bad mom for not want to go through that all over again. I feel that since I'm the one who went through all the struggle I should be entitled to making the decision that will see both me and my child healthy and most especially keep me sane.

322,How to tell your 3yo that her bestie at daycare died?,"My 3yo daughter started intermittently (2-3 times/month) attending a nearby daycare back in December.

That little girl also happened to be our neighbor. Yesterday, we received news that the little girl died from a sudden, undetected health condition. I don't know how to tell my daughter about this. I have no reference points to help her understand.

Any advice you have for approaching this situation would be helpful. UPDATE Huge thanks for all the words of advice and support. This weighed on me a lot. I did tell her when we got home this evening as I personally felt it was the right thing to do. I said it as straightforward as possible. ‚Äú[friend] died.

When seen by a doctor, the cough and laboured breathing they had earlier had largely disappeared.

Apparently croup is notorious for not always presenting serious symptoms during the day.

328,My 5 y/o son had a meltdown last night and now my family wants to take his birthday away,"I‚Äôm sorry this is long. TLDR; My 5 year old had a bad meltdown with cuss words and hitting last night and today his his birthday. My family thinks he doesn‚Äôt deserve to celebrate today because of it. What do I say/do? My son‚Äôs birthday is today. Last night, he had a really really bad meltdown. He started getting mouthy and talking back and then out no where took a toy away from his little sister. My husband and I told him that it‚Äôs not okay to speak that way and asked him to give the toy back to her. Then he threw it at her. That sent him to the corner for a time-out. Once in time-out, he started banging on the walls, saying he hates our stupid family. He ran out of time out after a few seconds and then his grandpa (we live with my parents) put him back in the corner to which my son then yells ‚ÄúWhat the F**k.‚Äù This is all happening during dinner and everyone is exhausted and just done at this point, so everyone leaves him be and walks away. I got up from dinner and took him to my bedroom and had a calm discussion with him asking what he‚Äôs feeling and why is he acting this way. He tells me that he is angry that his birthday is tomorrow but he isn‚Äôt with his family or friends from our old house and that he just wishes he could go back. (For context, we moved from California to Oregon 4 months ago). He‚Äôs been having a hard time adjusting. I talked with him about his behavior and he said his brain was telling him to nice but his body was being mean instead. So together we talked things through and he came up with a new plan of action when he starts misbehaving and I think it‚Äôs great. He said: 1: Tell him ‚ÄúCalm down. Relax your body.‚Äù 2: If he keeps misbehaving, go to the corner. 3: If he keeps misbehaving, try the corner one more time. 4: If he keeps at it, he loses electronics. I told him I like his plan so we‚Äôre going to try it. And so we went back out to everyone and he apologized for his behavior, told them our new plan and also threw in that when he turns 6 tomorrow, he is going to automatically behave like a nice boy because he‚Äôs getting older and wiser. (lol) So here we are at today, his birthday. We aren‚Äôt having a party or big celebration because mainly we don‚Äôt really know anyone here since we just moved. So it‚Äôs just our little family celebrating and I want to make him feel special. We have presents for him, a few decorations for around the table, and a cake. When I was asking what time should I start setting it up, my mom said ‚Äúare you really celebrating his birthday after what he did last night?‚Äù And I said ‚Äúyeah of course I am.‚Äù and she then proceeded to tell me how her her and my stepdad think he shouldn‚Äôt get any presents because of his behavior and that he doesn‚Äôt deserve any ‚Äúfun stuff.‚Äù And I said ‚Äúare you kidding me? He‚Äôs SIX and it‚Äôs his birthday.‚Äù and she said ‚Äúyeah, celebrate his birthday but don‚Äôt do the decorations or presents.‚Äù And she also said that they aren‚Äôt getting him a present now because of his behavior. I told her flat out that I don‚Äôt agree with her. As far as my husband‚Äôs stance on all this, he thinks we should do all the stuff at home, but not go out to celebrate (we were thinking chuck e. cheese or round 1 or something). Yes, his behavior last night was horrible and unacceptable. But I worked him him to find out why he was having difficult time and how we can work on this in the future. I feel like punishing him by taking away his dang BIRTHDAY is just outrageous and uncalled for. He is 6. That doesn‚Äôt dismiss his behavior, but I also thing that‚Äôs too harsh of discipline for his age and how excited he is. Birthdays are still magical and special and fun at this age. I don‚Äôt want him to lose that because of a bad meltdown.",,False,False,parenting

So anyways I need some advice. My son's teacher gives him a homework packet every Monday that is due every Friday. This packet contains front to back pages of usually 20-24 pages a week.. When he comes home from school I have to make him do it obviously so he gets a good grade but it is really wearing on both of us. He just wants to relax after spending most of his day in school, and I could understand like 1 or 2 easy or fun pages of homework at this age, but it isn't easy and it isn't fun for him. It's usually early math learning or writing which he spends half of the day in school already practicing. On top of that, he has quarterly sight words to learn and books for us to read that we have to somehow find time to do among this 4-5 pages of homework every night. I've tried doing it right when we get home, after he plays for a bit, right before bed, but it still stresses him out and he says he's at school too long. Is this a lot of homework for his age? When I was in kindergarten my HW consisted of like an art project or a book to read every few days. Other students parents in his class don't seem to have an issue with it, or making their kids do it, and I get it's so he retains what he learned in class but I just want to pull my hair out or do half of it for him so he can use what little free time he has to do things he likes. I guess this is a rant/vent more than advice but any advice to make this bs easier for my kindergartener would be appreciated a lot! Edit : to answer some common questions Yes this is for real and its ridiculous This is something the entire district is on board with, switching classes or schools will have the same outcome I can't just have him not do it, if he consistently doesn't turn in homework the school says they can hold him back next year This is in Florida Yes i have talked with the teacher and administrators, it is a district wide policy My only solution right now is to do a lot of it for him in his handwriting so he doesn't have to spend over an hour a day doing this boring bs I am going to find other parents that think it's also atrocious and try to go to the district superintendent I agree that this is outrageous for any elementary grade and finally Yes this is a regular back to school schedule, 7:20am to 2:30pm he is there.

Now, this was a Latino family that had gatherings literally every weekend (sometimes Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and each day would be at a different family member‚Äôs house). I loved spending time with them for this reason. There was always something going on. Over about 4-5 years, it got to the point that I was considered a member of the family by many of them. I attended their weddings, birthdays, and funerals. On that day, 10 or so years ago, I was sitting on the couch playing guitar with my friend and a few of the cousins. Some of them sang, some of them were just listening. When I handed the guitar over to one of the cousins, one of the young kids (a girl about 5 or 6 years old) came and sat on my lap to continue listening and watching what was going on. There was nowhere else to sit in the room and I didn‚Äôt mind it. But she quickly jumped off when her mom freaked out and yelled something along the lines of, ‚Äú[First, Middle, Last Name]!!

334,Are monkey clothes ok on black or mixed kids?,"My wife and I just got a bunch of clothes from a neighbor, and a lot of them are monkey themed. We are white and took custody of our nephew after his mom passed away. He is mixed white and black. For me it doesn't matter because he is now my son and we aren't dressing him in a monkey shirt to be racist or what ever. My wife is iffy about it with how others may feel. I do remember some drama over a clothing maker that had a black kid in a monkey shirt as an advertisement. I just don't see the harm when there is no ill intent. He goes to his grandparents a lot, whom are black, and we don't want to inadvertently offend them or anyone else. Just to me, a innocent monkey on a shirt shouldn't be met with discontent. Any opinions are greatly appreciated!  Edit: Wanted to say thanks to everyone for quick and insightful responses. I understand there is a long road of learning ahead raising a child of a different race.

335,Why are Boomer Grandparents So Fussy?,"I genuinely remember having a childhood over 30 years ago with crayons, bikes, camping trips. Parents doing laundry. Car trips. Happy Meals. Being kid level dirty. Going to the beach.because it was free. Parents smoking. Ok you've got the idea. I'm on the old end of the Millennial thing. My own grandmother broke out old toys the spirograph and Perfection. I basically had run of her house on some level. I could open cupboards and drawers for a towel or colored pencils. She would go over very old family pictures and name relative's and tell stories. My kids (the grands) are going to my Mom's (Gram) in an hour to bake with her. Which literally never happens. Suddenly I'm prepping my kids to be calm, don't use a loud voice. Listen to her. Be polite. Don't mess with her cat. You can't go upstairs, she doesn't like it. I'm on eggshells. My Mom's house is a damn glass palace with antiques and glass and China teacups. Silver spoons and irreplaceable plates.  Old this and priceless that. And she freaks regularly. Shoes have to wiped really specifically. Because her floors are ""special"". We were raised by hippies who finally got some scratch $$$ in the bank. And have very little interest in this grandparents thing. And their timeshare in Mexico is more important. Their hobbies collecting rare China outweigh a relationship with grandkids. Well wish us luck ü§ûshe'll probably use real jadeite for serving pieces. Also. Talk to her!?! Hahaha these types don't take suggestions to well. Edit: We're home. It didn't go badly, I hear.

336,Why would you say something like this to a stranger?,"Today I was in a restaurant with my spouse and ten month old baby. The baby was a bit squirmy, but overall we had a nice time. At the next table were two kids, roughly four and six years old, and their parents. The kids were quiet, playing games on their parents‚Äô phones. We didn‚Äôt interact at all except when the baby smiled at one of their kids and the kid waved back. We all smiled at each other because it was cute. The other family finished before we did. The mom stopped at our table and said ‚ÄúJust so you know, it gets a lot harder.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt smiling or joking.

She arrived masked and only took it off when I said it was fine unless she wanted to keep it on. She washed her hands and had done a LFT before she drove over. She made tea whilst I fed baby. She made sure she was out of sight until he finished as he was getting distracted. Then she chatted to me first but still involved the baby. She didn‚Äôt grab him but introduced herself slowly. In no time we were all playing on his floor mat, she was harmonising nursery rhymes with me, baby was giggling and she had made another round of tea. She was holding him and he started to fuss and she handed him straight back to me without being asked! He fell asleep and we had a fully adult conversation which I don‚Äôt get very often.

The drawers are a shambles. Sometimes I tidy it but mostly I don‚Äôt. Their toys aren‚Äôt crazy organised, they do tidy them up though. They both ‚Äúmake‚Äù their own beds, and their rooms are never Instagram worthy. So many people find this approach really strange.

341,Was my reaction right or wrong?,"So I was at a friend's BBQ (it's summer here) today and there were lots of other children running around and excited. My boy is under one so I had him sitting on the deck with me, one other baby. One of the older kids (4 years) was playing with a hose. They came over and I suggested to the child that a hose wasn't a great toy and maybe go and turn it off and find something else to do. The child looked at me and then turned the hose on my baby. It was chaos. My boy started screaming so I was trying to calm him down. The 4 year old dropped the hose. I looked at the mum and she shrugged and said ""children will be children"" ... she didn't apologize, she didn't discipline her child, she just stood there thinking it was funny to hose down a 10 month old. I said nothing, I walked away to get my boy changed and when I came back I heard her telling everyone I had thrown a tantrum over a little bit of water. I get that kids get over excited, but a 4 year old hosing down a baby sounds like it should earn at least a discussion about right and wrong. It's not as if I went off on her and told her how to parent so I hardly think 'tantrum' is fair. How would you react in that situation?",,False,False,parenting

343,Psychologist says only my wife should help with my daughter's sleep. Is this the norm?,"Since the pandemic began I have been helping my daughter to sleep in her own room. I admit we later spoiled her by letting her sleep in our bedroom many nights and even put her bed with ours for several months when we had our newborn with us. However, she is 4 years old now, and I am trying to make her sleep in her own bedroom again, by being with her in the same bed until she falls asleep. Though almost every night she wakes up at midnight and calls me with the baby monitor and I go to help her sleep again. I told this to my psychologist, which claims to be an expert with infants development, and tells me it's inappropriate I help my daughter to sleep. That since she is a girl, her mother should be the one with her for this kind of situations. Is this really true? I am just curious because I am trying to make the change now but my daughter keeps asking why I can't be with her anymore for sleep.  EDIT: Thanks everyone for your comments, I had the same reaction when I heard this ""advice"". Let me just clarify more the situation. His ""advice"" is basically that fathers should bond more with their boys and mothers with their daughters, so clearly a gender thing. According to him (and his books, which I will definitely ask which ones), this helps the kids not be ""confused"" while growing up. Unfortunately I couldn't dig deeper with this topic because I had 5 minutes left in the session, but I also asked myself later, ""what about single dads and moms? what if mom or dad is on a trip for the weekend? what if one one has a full time job and the other one is a stay at home parent?""

Usually he goes right back to sleep but tonight he was very much awake and fussy. I brought him to the living room with our rocking chair and held him on my chest/shoulder as I sang a lullaby to him and rocked him to sleep.

352,Tickling & Abuse,"When I was a child my mom would pin me down and tickle me relentlessly.

She apologized but didn‚Äôt seem to understand the extent of this abusive behaviour. Fast forward to the last couple of years and she asked to move in with us in exchange for child care. I was naive and thought after talking to her specifically about how tickling traumatized us, that she would never do such behaviour again. I specifically told her she is not allowed to do any such thing if she wants to move in. Well, last week I caught her tickling my daughter (18Months) and she made excuses.

Our girl is 6 months now and I‚Äôve been feeling this way for awhile but just became ready to, I‚Äôm unhappy. I‚Äôm unhappy with my relationship. Obviously with getting pregnant so early we didn‚Äôt have an exactly solid foundation. There are a couple issues I have with my relationship but I have no idea how to fix them. my partner continued and continues to go out drinking 2-3 times a week. Not just a drink but like not getting home until 3am drinking. It‚Äôs just this unspoken expectation that I‚Äôll stay home with baby. I‚Äôm not a priority in my relationship. He had bought season tickets for football, our daughter was born in September. He only has one day off a week typically: Sunday. This means for the first 3 months of my daughters life he was gone almost every weekend. When he walks through the door he doesn‚Äôt even greet me simply asks where the baby is. After the baby‚Äôs gone down and we‚Äôre alone, he sits on his phone until it‚Äôs time for me to go to bed, we might chat a bit in between. The only time we‚Äôve gotten a sitter is about once a month when there‚Äôs a group function we both attend. there is literally no intimacy. At all. We‚Äôve not had sex in 10 months, being pregnant freaked him out and we have not since our daughter was born. We don‚Äôt go to bed at the same time, don‚Äôt cuddle, maybe kiss once or twice a day but more of a peck than anything else. I feel like a roommate and a mom. I don‚Äôt feel like a person and I certainly don‚Äôt feel like a girlfriend. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I don‚Äôt know how to fix this but I know I can‚Äôt keep doing this. I already have so much resentment. Any advice is welcome UPDATE: hey for anyone who cared, you were right, he did cheat on me. I was 3 weeks pp and he slept with someone else while on a drunken bender. Then continued to hang out with her every time he went out drinking. Even let me meet the girl without me knowing anything!

355,Should I let my 9 year old daughter wear whatever she wants?,"In the last 6 months she's really fallen in love with clothes. As she puts it, ""my aesthetic is pastel goth, goth and kid core...""  I only have basic rules, nothing ""sexy"", her clothes have to be clean and any graphic tees have to be appropriate for school. We live in the Northeast so no matter how much she begs, she has to wear something that covers her legs in the winter, so that means pants under her shorts, dresses and skirts. Sometimes when things get really crazy in her outfits (long sleeve tie dye shirt under short sleeved plaid crop top, skull print leggings under a different type of tie dye shorts and mismatch striped socks and rainbow fingerless gloves) I have to bite my tongue. Her dad thinks I should tell her it doesn't match but I figure she'll learn that as she gets older. The last few weeks though, the fun of dressing up has become stressful. Yesterday she cried because she hates all her pants. None of them had belt loops to attach her chain. I tried to offer suggestions but they made her angry and she yelled at me to get out of her room. Now I'm worried it's not fun anymore and it's just stressing her out. *Edit: I have received some good advice, and nice comments, thank you. I've also seen a few questions and assumptions now about the amount of time she spends online, the content she is viewing, how her reaction must be because of public school, because (wow) she has no friends, or because she has no extracurriculars. She did have TikTok for a bit, but we uninstalled it after talking to her about how consuming short clips of content over and over is not good for your brain/trolling and cyber bullying/don't believe everything you see online, etc. She no longer uses it on her devices. As far as YouTube, yes she uses YouTube. We watch a lot of Good Mythical Morning together, and she watches DIY videos on how to customize LPS and other toys. She does not go to public school. The school she does attend is very small. She has many friends. If they're not here, she's at their house. Also she has hobbies and extracurriculars. I don't think listing them is necessary. I realize she still has access to other YouTube content and making/viewing TikTok's when she's with her friends.

I've had a few rough experiences with kids at my house and one kid stood out in particular. Every time I'd ask him to stop doing something or try to redirect him he would go and tattle on me to his mom. She told me I just had to let him be a kid and have fun and since he was allowed to do it at home I couldn't expect him to not do it at my house. I do have some rules that have been frowned upon by other parents. I don't want the kids screaming at the top of their lungs indoors unless they are in danger. I also have a ""clean one mess before another is made"" rule but I guess I'm not allowed to expect kids aged 3-6 to clean up after themselves with my assistance. I get told ""well you have a kid expect there to be messes"" or I get told I'm just lazy and I should allow the kids to take out every single toy in the house and I can clean up after all the kids leave. I always help the kids put the toys away and heavily praise them and I try to make it as fun as possible.

362,PSA: Do less laundry,"My wife and I have been losing our minds about laundry. We only have two kids, but they're still young so they get dirty constantly - spaghetti sauce, acrylic paints, dirt and mud, toothpaste on the PJs. It seemed the laundry machine was constantly on and there piles of folded clothes everywhere that never made their way back to drawers. Everything was clean all the time, but at what cost?! So we made a conscious decision about 2 weeks ago to get the kids to wear the same clothes a few times in a week without cleaning them. I'm not talking about sending them to school in filthy underwear. I just mean giving the t-shirt another day before washing it. PJs are OK for more than a few days. Jeans? Maybe once per week. Even socks are good for a second day if they pass the smell test. I gotta say it's made a massive difference to our mental health. The world hasn't ended. Teachers haven't called to complain. The house doesn't suddenly stink. We just have a few more hours a week that we used to spend washing clothes that probably didn't need it. Do less laundry. It's worth it. Edit: seems like I gave the impression that I‚Äôm sending my kids to school with filthy, stained clothes. That‚Äôs on me for trying to be funny - my bad.

363,How to make a toddler stop crying,"One time, at the grocery store, my daughter was having a full on meltdown. It involved having to put something on the belt to get scanned, and another item she wasn't allowed to play with. She was really going off, but I could not leave since it was mid check out. At some point, a man came up to her and told her that he would give her $1 to stop crying. Let me tell you, it worked right away. She was dumbfounded. He told her he would be watching, and she has to keep it up or she has to give the dollar back. I guess other people might find this offensive or weird, but that that man is still my hero.",,False,False,parenting

365,A stranger bought my tantruming child a toy.,"I was just cleaning up the playroom today when I saw my son‚Äôs toy lawnmower and remembered the day he got it. We had gone to Target to buy a potty. While picking out a really cute Elmo potty he spotted and fell in love with a toy lawnmower. He wouldn‚Äôt let it go so I told him he could play with it while he rode in the cart but we wouldn‚Äôt be buying it today. I mentally prepared for a big temper tantrum at the register and finished our shopping. When we got to the self checkout I rang up our purchases and then reminded him we would be leaving the mower behind. He had the expected reaction but I stood firm. I explained that we can‚Äôt buy every toy and I understand that he‚Äôs disappointed. As we were headed into the parking lot I thought a man said something to us but couldn‚Äôt really hear him over my son‚Äôs crying and kept pushing the cart to the car. I had just finished loading up my purchases and my crying toddler when the man came running up with the lawnmower. It clicked for me that he was asking if he could buy it for us. I have never experienced more conflicting simultaneous emotions. I was surprised. (Who buys a stranger‚Äôs child an expensive toy?) I was confused. (WTF is happening?) I was annoyed. (I wanted my child to learn that he can‚Äôt have everything he wants and here comes this guy to prove me wrong.) I was touched. (This man was beaming from the joy of his good deed. He really meant it as a helpful thing. I could tell.) I was embarrassed. (Do I not look like I can afford toys for him? Covid has really hit my self care routine.) And the deed was done. My two and a half year old was holding the mower box tightly in his hands, a smile of victory on his little face. He took his nap holding the lawnmower that afternoon. He‚Äôs turning four now and has (sort of) learned that he can‚Äôt have every toy he wants. But on that day he drifted off to sleep, holding his mower, confident in the knowledge that if mommy says no a kind stranger will appear.",,False,False,parenting

372,Update: Weirdest sleepover ever,"Original post here So, this woman has reached out asking for favors at least 8 or 9 times since the sleepover, all of which I declined. The favors ranged from sharing diapers and pull ups, to asking for money, to rides for her, her kids, and the oldest's father. She also asked if I could take all three kids for another ""sleepover"". I told her I could only take the oldest, because I'm home by myself on the weekends and three toddlers is too much for me when it's the only time I have to do laundry and clean. She responded that it was fine, it wouldn't be ""fair"" to only allow the oldest to go. Pretty sure that's code for ""I make my oldest daughter parent her siblings and I don't want to be stuck doing it instead"". So that's where we stand. She keeps reaching out for favors, I keep saying no. I may volunteer to pick up the kids to take them to the park now that it's warmer out, but that's probably it, and I'm not even sure I want to encourage this leech anymore than she already is. I'm sorry for the girls, because they get along so well, but I can't solve ALL the problems this family clearly has. I guess it's a good practice in setting boundaries though! Thanks for all the advice, I don't know if I could have stuck up for myself without all the validation here.

374,My husband is addicted to a game on his phone. Just had a disheartening experience.,"Tonight my husband (34M) and I (34F) attended the Kindergarten Roundup/Parent Informational Night at our kids school for our younger daughter. During almost the entire presentation and school tour, while sitting with the parents of a few of our second grader‚Äôs classmates, he chose to play a game on his iphone (Age of Z, on which he has spent over $1000in the last several months, which is an entirely different issue). I feel that this is really not a good look, especially in a setting where we are already known and recognized. I felt deeply embarrassed. I nudged him a few times at first but gave up because those negative interactions were easily observed by the other parents and teachers as well (he would give me a sneer and put away the phone for a minute or two, then take it back out). This game is far and away the biggest issue in our marriage (high school sweethearts, been together almost 20 years). We both have good jobs which allow us to be comfortable financially, which is why I have chosen to let the cost of the game slide a bit, because we all have our vices. After making it very clear to him that I wanted him to be more present with the kids and I and trying to help him understand how the whole phone game situation is pretty alarming when you look at the facts (TONS of money spent, not to mention hours and hours each day while he is working from home and on Zoom meetings), this just had such a different hurtful feel tonight. I was embarrassed at his utter rudeness and the image he was projecting to the other families and teachers. Given that we have been working on being more respectful to one another, and his general tendency to throw everything back on me, I‚Äôm wondering what would be the best and most impactful way to address this with him. I tend to get emotional very easily when having hard discussions and will become unable to get my thoughts out, which turns into him pointing out all of the ways he has also been unimpressed with me in the recent past. I also want to be considerate of the fact that we both have mental health challenges, although he denies that he does and will often project a reason for his struggles onto me. Things have been slightly improving lately and I don‚Äôt want to derail the progress we‚Äôve made, but I‚Äôm just sick about this.

Our living room is not very big, we have an eat in kitchen (no separate dining room), and a very small laundry room.

381,Preschooler Bitten On PENIS At Daycare,"My lovely almost-three-year-old came home today and very casually was like ""Mama, I got an ouchie on my penis,"" and he showed me a very gnarly bite mark on the top and bottom of his penis that was red, bruised, and had clearly drawn blood. This was a hard bite and must have been incredibly painful. My son is so easygoing and just a bubble of sparkles and joy (I'm not joking or being sarcastic, he's just unicorn magic in toddler form). He didn't seem that distressed ... but I am. He goes to one of the more expensive daycares in the main metropolitan area of our state (which is to say that there's the expectation of a certain level of diligence). We've sent three kids there and have never had a bad experience. Every little mark upon a child gets an ""ouch report"" and is carefully communicated and documented. There was no ouch report, so they weren't aware of it. That means that there's a rogue penis-biter accosting children out of the teachers' sight in his classroom. Or if they were aware of it and didn't communicate it ... more problems. I have heard that kids who are being abused at home sometimes act that out that abuse on others, but that's a gigantic conclusion to jump to. We plan on showing pictures of the injury to the center director tomorrow but what can we reasonably expect for a reaction? We teach all of our children that our private parts are for us only‚Äîor our parents or doctor if there's a medical issue. I can't expect a preschooler to grasp the concept or stand up for himself, though. What should the center be doing here? ETA: Sorry, I think I missed stating the obvious. My son did tell us that he was bitten and he did identify a child's name. I did not assume it was a bite based solely on the visual of the injury. Update 1: My husband talked to the center director this morning and the director was appropriately horrified. She will now talk to the teachers and try to figure out what happened and why it was missed (obviously, we are realistic and don't expect to ever know a concrete answer, also, keeping in mind that the center is going to cover their butts). The name my son said is, as it turns out, a kid in his class. Most unsettling to me, my husband reported that the kid seemed to be looking at my son awkwardly as he came in. It could be that we're projecting, or he's lying in wait for my toddler, which is horrific. The director is going to reach out to that kid's parents, document everything, and reach back out today. Most importantly, the perpetrator will be separated from my son as much as humanly possible. We were not able to get an appointment at the pediatrician's until later today, and we will take advice about a potential police report and a CPS report from the doctor. We are going to see what happens with the director's response before we consider making any big daycare decisions, as we have another child there currently, and our experience has overwhelmingly been positive. Update 2: My son went to the pediatrician, who examined him and was not concerned about any long-term damage, which is great. We brought up the question of whether this could be the biter's way of acting out some of their own trauma and the doctor basically said that it wasn't our job to come to that conclusion, it was the daycare's. The pediatrician did not recommend opening a file with CPS unless we find out more from the daycare about what happened, proving it wasn't an accident, etc. So it feels like ""case closed"" from the pediatrician's perspective. The center DOES have cameras, as it turned out, and they called us this afternoon to say that they had reviewed half of the day and didn't see anything. They are going to watch the rest of the day tomorrow and see if they can figure out when the attack happened. The footage does show my son playing with the boy in question a few times, but nothing that would suggest he was hurt, crying afterward, any of that. I'm really curious to see if they come up with the incident on tape. Update 3: We heard a very vague update from the daycare at the end of last week about how they're reviewing everything, etc. I called them back to express that this was insufficient. They didn't say whether they found the footage, whether they had communicated with the other child's parents, they didn't explore why no teacher either saw the incident or was alerted, etc. We finally heard today (more than a week later) that they found the footage (it didn't happen in the classroom, it happened in the gym, on an indoor play structure) and they are now having the director of the entire system come and review and make a plan. Apparently, my son and two other children were showing their genitals to one another. I cannot speculate as to whose idea this was or who initiated but I can say that a) my son has never showed his genitals recreationally at home so this behavior seems unusual for him, and b) one of the kids is much older (my son and the other kid  moved up from the toddlers room at the same time). This older kid is also the biter, and we have learned that there have been some behavioral struggles with this particular child. So it is being escalated. I will probably write a separate update post when they reach back out. Thanks to everyone for tracking this and for all of your advice!",,False,False,parenting

I made a request to wife, aunts, uncles and grandparents‚Ä¶please do not buy gifts that have a lot of small pieces (which of course they all did). This was not to deprive my daughter of any particular toys. This was because I am a stay at home dad and spend a great deal of my time picking up after my kids on top of dishes, laundry, cooking, shopping, yard work, chauffeuring etc etc etc.  And because 3 year olds don‚Äôt keep that shit together.  And because now, my entire house is covered in legos and duplos and little plastic plants and puzzle pieces and a million little accessories that go to other toys.  I will pick all these up and put them away, but in less than 2 minutes they will be scattered all over the house again.  I just wanna gather all these little pieces of everything up and take them over to my in laws house, dump them on the floor, kick them around like I‚Äôm kicking sand, watch them pick it alllll up, and then do it again immediately.  And when they‚Äôre looking at me pissed and horrified, tell them this is what I have to do several times a day, every day of my life and is why I specifically ask for them NOT TO BUY SHIT LIKE THIS FOR MY KIDS. On top of that, my wife got her this massive Barbi dream home thing that has about 50 stupid little parts like dishes, hangers, tv‚Äôs, pillows beds toilets etc etc etc. all these were scattered around immediately and some were just lost.

No.  That‚Äôs disrespectful.  The shit all goes into one big bin or else I throw it out and am done with it.  I‚Äôm already completely overwhelmed as it is.

I do appreciate all the comments, even ones that are not so easy to read. Though I do want to say, pointing out things I've done wrong years ago doesn't help much now. Are there things I would do differently if I could go back? Absolutely. However, I can't change how many kids I have, how strict I was when she was a toddler, or the fact that we were foster parents for 5 years. Those things are done, for better or worse. Advice about moving forward is of course welcome.

We've tried outpatient therapy since she's been home but she refuses to talk, tells me that making her just makes her feel like I'm telling her I think there's something wrong with her. She is on medication and does talk very briefly with her psychiatrist, but mostly it's just yeah I feel fine. Here's the biggest issue right now. She is constantly attacking her 10 year old brother. Everything he does is wrong. She hates the way he chews his food, the way he sits in his chair, the clothes he wears. He walks in a the room and instantly she's like ""ew, why would you walk like that?"" It's literally non stop. And my ten year old will try to ignore her, but sometimes he starts crying, especially when she calls him stupid. He's been struggling in school lately and really sensitive about it. It's like she found a new button to press and presses it as much as she can. Eventually he will explode and lash back and call her names back and then she gets furious that he ""never gets in trouble"" and he's so mean,etc. She projects onto him all the things she hates about herself. But is there anyway to point out to her that's what she's doing? We've tried having calm conversations in moments when they're not fighting and she just insists he's a terrible person.",,False,False,parenting
397,UPDATE: My son's ultra religious mother is teaching him to be a homophobe.,"Original So I followed through on my plan. I contacted the mother of some of the neighbourhood kids and ex friend of my son's mother. When I filled her in she was more than happy to help. We all went to the community center as a group and my son had an absolute blast. The second we got home he asked me if we could go again the next day. We did just that. As a matter of fact we have gone 4 times since and as of today have even paid for a membership. The staff are amazing, the guy who runs it is a total rockstar and it couldn't have possibly been a better experience. He went to his mom's over the weekend and I know for certain he would have told her. Total. Radio. Silence. I did this for the right reasons, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't get some petty satisfaction knowing that she's probably foaming at the mouth over it but wouldn't dare say a word outside her bubble for fear of being outed as the homophobic sack of shit she is. My son is thrilled and is already planning to go there on his birthday for a movie night. They even donated a bike to him today which blew me away. It's super nice and now frees me up financially to do something different for his birthday. I'm touched by their immediate kindness and acceptance. My son will learn more about love and kindness there than he ever will going to church. This profoundly negative and worrisome issue turned into something amazing and I wanted to just take a moment to thank everyone who took the time to comment and make suggestions. I took them all to heart and it couldn't have gone better. We're working on a book as well called ""Queer Heroes"" that goes into detail on noteable folks from the LGBT community and their accomplishments and I've been working to squash any more of his mom's hateful rhetoric that pop's up.

398,11 year old daughter is‚Ä¶.different?,"So I‚Äôm not sure how to word all of this but I will do my best. My middle daughter is 11, just finished 4th grade. She was ‚Äúheld back‚Äù from Kindergarten and put in pre-k because her  preschool teachers believed that while she was highly intelligent she was emotionally behind. She is very bright. When she was just 5 she was doing 700pc puzzles and could build some of the coolest stuff on Minecraft. She has always gotten top grades as well. However she‚Äôs just‚Ä¶.different from other kids. Not in a bad way, at least in my opinion. She gets hyper focused on things and will memorize some of the most ‚Äúrandom‚Äù things. Ask her about Godzilla and this kid will be able to tell you specific dates and what inspired this or that, names of directors, etc. She is socially a little awkward. Overly trusting and na√Øve. She once licked a ‚Äústrange smear‚Äù on a pole and reported it was bbq sauce. When I asked why she licked it she said ‚Äúwell I thought it was blood‚Äù. She‚Äôs very sensitive emotionally as well. She doesn‚Äôt like making eye contact and will go stone cold if she‚Äôs in trouble, almost like she‚Äôs totally checked out. Personally I don‚Äôt think I need to have her evaluated or anything because I truly love all her quirks, but am I doing her a disservice by not taking her to be seen?

She gets along with my kids, so she asked to talk to my 16 year old. During the phone convo, my kid comes out to her great grandmother as a lesbian and talks about her date that she is excited about. Everything seems fine until I get the phone back. She instantly laid into me and told me I was letting my kid be ""one of those,"" and it is my fault because we don't go to church. She said if I was a good parent and if my daughter was normal, she would not do something as stupid as wear a tuxedo and look like a ""girly man."" I got super pissed and told her to fuck off and hung up. She tried to call back, but I leave my voicemail full on purpose. I am going to change my number once I can afford to pay my phone bill.

He can't walk yet, but he wants to hold my fingers and walk, so we go to the park and walk around doing that for awhile. He climbs on the equipment and I follow behind him. We swing on the swings (him on my lap) etc. I try not to get in anyone's way. If there's bigger kids on the equipment, then we go do something else, it's no big deal. I get that I take up alot of space following around behind him, so I only let him play on the equipment if nobody else is there. Otherwise, we just spend time digging in the dirt, walking around, swinging etc. Its a great way to keep him occupied anf tire him out. He's very high energy lol. The park is intended for big kids. There's no ""baby section."" Its all big kid equipment. There's no baby swings. He still likes to play in there and tries climbing on the stuff Sometimes a group of kids and their grandma are there.

415,Wife wants to let son sleep while diaper is filled with poop.,"So I had a recent discussion with my wife because our son(1) isn't sleeping that well lately. She thinks that he needs the sleep and the diaper can wait until the next morning. ( He's constantly screaming like hell when we're changing it) I think that poop needs to be cleaned asap because the skin won't like it and he already has some red spots down there and it hurts him when we're wiping it. I put some skincare on it, and it seems to help him. How  would you handle this situation and is there anything that I can do to counter that screaming during nightly diaper changes?",,False,False,parenting

418,Update: Daughter (6) slapped in face by boy (10),"I'm so devastated. There is footage of everything on the bus and the principal reviewed it. My daughter instigated it by bonking his head SIXTEEN times even after being told nicely to stop and also opened his and his friends backpacks several times. The principal said the slap looked more like a tap on the face as well. I am so disappointed, embarrassed... there's no words that can describe how upset and sad I feel. My daughter will be home in 5 minutes and I don't even know what to say or do. I'm a young mom and I feel like I'm not prepared to handle this. I feel so many emotions. Thank you guys for all of the support on my previous post. I'm so sorry that it ended up being my child being the instigator. My daughter lied, got parents called, multiple boys in trouble and my husband and I really went to bat for her. My husband even asked how these parents are raising their kids. Jokes on us, how are we raising her? Any advice would be helpful. I'm so so so sad. How could she lie about something like this?",,False,False,parenting
419,15 year old daughter and her high school dress code.,"My 15 year old daughter is in 10th grade this year. We moved last year to a new state and she did 9th grade on distance learning. Her old middle school had a dress code. A couple of weeks ago in PE the boys had their shirts off and she took off her sweater, underneath she was wearing a spaghetti strap tank top that showed a sliver of abdomen.  She was told to put her coat back on. she was very upset about the double standard. As far as I know she has not been talked to again about her dress, but the school is obviously having issues because they sent an email saying so and what is expected. I agree with her about the double standard in PE. I also in some part agree with the schools dress code. Lots of places in life have dress codes and you just have to follow them.  I want to support my daughter and her opinions and dealing with something unfair. The principal called today and said she was caught on camera posting flyers saying my education is more important than what I wear and other sayings. I agree! Her stomach and shoulders shouldn't be inherently deemed inappropriate and sexual just because she is female. The principle told her she is creating chaos on her campus and that their are other ways to express her opinion. How do I explain to her the right way to go about bringing up her concerns without breaking the rules of the school? I tried telling her she jumped right to protesting without giving any school authorities a chance to respond to or address her concerns. She is all mad at me now and said she did nothing wrong.

420,How are you handling post-COVID society without having your <12yo kids vaccinated?,"Hey there, My wife and I have both received our second shot and we're getting close to that two-week mark, which is considered fully vaccinated. However, we have two young children who cannot yet be vaccinated, as their ages are not yet approved (Canada here, but I believe the same applies everywhere). We're very nervous about potentially bringing the virus home, as the delta variant is spreading in Canada and there are cases of breakthrough infections for vaccinated people. If not for the kids, I wouldn't be concerned about breakthrough infections, as they don't seem to be severe, but I don't want to get our kids infected. We have two months of summer ahead of us before they go back to school, which we've accepted as necessary, but we're nervous about taking risks in the meantime.  Is anyone else struggling with this? What is your view of the situation with young children who are unable to be vaccinated?  NOTE: I don't want any replies that question the science or health experts. Believe whatever you want, but I'm not interested. I'm only interested in responses from parents who follow the experts' advice and science, and are basing their behaviour/decisions on that.

421,Generally accepted rules when it comes to using other people's property?,"I witnessed an interaction at a campground that left me confused. A young child and his mother arrive at the campground beach. Child asks if he can play with a floaty toy that's on the beach. It's early morning, no one else is at the beach. Mom says ""sure, go ahead."" Later on, child is playing with this toy when some older children arrive at the beach. They approach the child and say ""Oh, that's our toy, you can't play with it."" Child says ""but my mommy said I could."" And they say ""but it's ours, you can't."" Child's mother then comes over and says ""No, it's ok, I gave him permission to use it."" The other children say ""But it's OURS."" And Mom says ""well you shouldn't have left it on the beach if you didn't want someone to use it."" The other kids go off in a huff, obviously not brave enough to push it with this woman, and her children continues to play with their toy in the water. Now I'm sitting there thinking, if my kid had asked I would have said ""That's not our toy, we can't play with it until the owner is here and then we can ask them if it's ok."" Or I would have at least agreed to give their toy back to them when they informed us that it belonged to them. Am I being wayyyyy too polite?

In conversation he agrees and seems open and honest. Then I check his screentime and lo and behold, All The Porn. Now what? We‚Äôre a sex-positive household but that doesn‚Äôt include being porn-positive. Studies show how damaging this type of media is for developing minds, not to mention setting them up for grossly unrealistic ideas when they enter the real world. Do I go nuclear and take the phone/iPad away altogether? Screen limits haven‚Äôt worked. Time limits haven‚Äôt either. I‚Äôm never in favor of cutting him off from friends but I don‚Äôt trust him at all right now due to the history of lying about this.

424,I would like to rage!! My kid broke me.,"My son (21) has been lying to us for 2 years about going to college. He literally faked going and sat at the college for the entire semester. Then covid hit and it was all online. He stated he's  only taking one class on xday of the week. So we wake him to attend the class. Which he faked. I started getting suspicious when I asked why he's only taking one class when he's supposed to be full time. He gave bullshit answers that didn't make sense. I would bring it up again saying, dude.. I did college online. It's never just one class. Wtf is going on? So let me back up and toss in some history.  In HIGH school we talked about what do you want to after graduation.  I asked if he thought military,  nope. Okay well the  you gotta do college.  He then says he wants to do something with computers. Fabulous.  Getting a FREE College degree just got put in place and he would be able to do this without any financial burden for all of us. I would ask how if he need help registering, getting the financial aid in place.   Nope, I got it was what he told us. Apparently the school did that all for him.  He did get his acceptance letter to the college  and we were so excited for him.  I told him that as long as he is in college we would financially take care of him and he would not have to work. I even paid the bus passes to and from the college.  This is how far he took this lie. Then he finally comes clean and I go ballistic.  Yelling at him was useless cause you can literally see him check out while looking at you. This boy lived in his bed playing  video games for 2 years while being a financial drain on us. So I said get a job. Now. He hemmed and hawwed at that as well cause he wanted a job with computers but he lacked a drivers license and the experience or knowledge to get the job.  I told him to get off that high horse cause it's not happening. You need a job now. So I got him an interview at a local restaurant as a dishwasher.  He got it and jumped into it whole heartidly.  He has the management drive but no ambitious to try to get there. Like he literally needs to be poached with an offer. So few months down the line I suggest hey.. look for something better. Instead they give him a raise to keep him and he stays. We talked about college again  and he said he try it again.. I got him enrolled, did all the paperwork and got him back on the free college avenue.   He opts for online courses using covid as an excuse and then tells he's been depressed for years. This was a shocker, cause he never showed it and never spoke up if I ask how he's doing etcetera.  We get him medicated. He is also ADHD. So he has meds for that but never takes them. He fumbles thru the first semester as I am making sure he's at class,  doing the work and just boosting his confidence.During this time I told him he will have to work and goto school cause we're not playing that game again. He also pays us xamount to stay in the house and pays his own bills. Which I make sure gets paid. The amount he pays is a drop in the bucket compared to what he is bringing home.  He spent all his money on things he's wanted ; expensive kid stuff. And the college gave him a covid relief check of 3k that he bought  an expensive gaming computer instead of helping the family get a new car. I gave him the option to help and he bought the computer. The semester ends and we are on winter break. I bugged him for his class schedule for the next semester and he always forgot to give it to me. So ya know where this is going. He didn't enroll I any and infact to the college he didn't want to do this and disenrolled. He couldn't even finish a semester.During this time frame our relationship changed cause I needed to be more calm and talk with out yelling. And he knows this. I also asked him to speak to me whenever there is a problem or something you need and we will calmly talk.  I gave him multiple avenues to converse with me if he felt he could talk face to face. And then he comes clean literally  2 days before classes are to start that he is not I  college and dropped out. I can't even express how hurt, heartbroken, and soo pissed off about this. It's been a week and I can't talk to him. I am civil. I feed him. I fume as I take him and pick him up from work. And he has yet to even try to apologize.  He keeps acting like nothing is wrong but I can't let this go.   I heard second hand that he was talking to a fellow dishwasher who's in their late 40s go off about how expensive college is and there was no way he could do that. And my boy says yeah, that's why I'm not in college.It's mind boggling how he could think that way on a free ride. So husband and I decided he has to now play the adult game and get his license,  insurance, pay rent, pay part of all utilities and food expenses.  I totaled that up to him giving half his weekly paycheck, which I am fine  with. And he will have his own personal bills to pay that will eat up the rest of his check.  He obviously needs a hard wake up call to see what adulting really is like. I tried explaining to him that the computer job he wants is starting at 20 an hour.I don't know what to do now. I always was able to forgive and let it go.. but this time I literally can't. Help.",,False,False,parenting

426,We did a Covid vaccine trial,"Newish to Reddit so please remove if vaccine conversations aren‚Äôt allowed. My wife (38F) and I (39M) had our daughter a little over two years ago and she came home from the hospital literally a week before the world effectively shut down from Covid. I cannot begin to express how frightening a time that was to have a little person join the world, I was figuring out how to make a face mask from T-Shirt sleeves and we rarely allowed ourselves in public and never for anything optional at that stage. We live far from our families in a new town, we were all alone. Fast forward a few years, around 6 months ago we decided that we would enter her in a vaccine trial for the pfizer Covid vaccine. The reaction from other parents was often mixed, though I struggle to understand those who weren‚Äôt desperate to vaccinate their kids at that stage. Some would be politely surprised but clearly disagreed with the decision, others were much more supportive (and all of this often broke down along the lines you‚Äôd probably expect). She had little or no reaction to either shot, and we‚Äôd guessed she might‚Äôve had the placebo (as 1/3 of participants did). Covid exposure came up twice at daycare and we managed to miss it or get very mild cases. When we were unblinded we found, very excitedly, that she‚Äôd received doses of the vaccine during the trial and she‚Äôs been terrific through it all. While we participated at the core to protect our LO, we also felt strongly about what we were doing to help move the medical science along and get life back to normal. The stories of pediatric cases turning into MIS  were horrifying to me regardless of their relatively low likelihood. The thought of her intubated I simply couldn‚Äôt take. A one percent chance of it being your child was often more than we wanted to risk. Bottom line is that she‚Äôs come through very well, likely did have Covid but with a very mild case, and I think it‚Äôs one of the best decisions we‚Äôve made as parents. Please vaccinate your children for this and other diseases (when appropriate and when you‚Äôre able), we can all do our part to make sure our families and other families in our communities aren‚Äôt at risk of serious disease and illness.

428,Son's friend's mom keeps asking to take my son,"My son made friends with the neighbor boy down the street. I met the mom, and brought my son to the park for a play date with her and her son. The boys play well together, but the mom showed multiple red flags. Among other things, she told me a 45 minute long story about how unfair it was that she was fired from her job for confrontation, racism (using racial slurs towards coworker), and while telling this story she described another coworker with an insulting term for lesbian, and then said her boss was terrible for firing her instead of siding with her. Of course, I don't know her situation, but the way she spoke made it clear that she is a problem. She told me her medical history, her troubles with her husband, their financial difficulties, and this was all during our first meeting. I'm not a big talker, but I didn't get a chance to speak because she talked non-stop. She invited my son to play at her house, and against my better judgment, I hoped for the best and allowed it for an hour and a half. When my son came home, he said the dad was mean and that he was laying on the couch in his underwear (look, we do that at my house too, but not when other people's kids are visiting). He said him and his friend spent the time watching Squid Game (my son is 9! The other boy is 7!) and playing a video game where the objective was to smash the other players heads until they exploded. I'm not sure what game this was, but my son said ""I'll never forget the things I saw."" My son didn't get the chance to tell me about these things right away because when he came home from the visit, the mom brought her son over and told him (without getting my approval first) that he could stay at my house while she went to ""pick up take-out"" and I agreed, because I have nothing against the boy. I expected that it would take the mom 30-45 minutes at the most to pick up food, but she didn't come back to pick up her son until 9pm. 9 is my son's bed time, and this wasn't a huge problem, but it struck me as unstructured/irresponsible, especially considering that her son is 2 years younger than mine. Bedtime is important in my house, and my son didn't get to sleep until 10pm because of this situation. We are also strict about video games and TV ratings. We use parental controls to avoid exposure to things that are not age-appropriate, and my son was shocked enough by what he witnessed to tell his dad and I that it bothered him. The mom contacted me today, first a text, then 5 minutes later a phone call, and said she was ready to pick up my son and take him to another city to play at a play place to ""get him off [my] hands"" and I said no. I thanked her for the offer, but said that today wasn't a good day, and that I would be happy to accompany my son to the play place on another day. The mom said ok, but then said she would bring her son over to my house later. I said again that it wasn't a good day, and that I have some work to do before the week starts but she didn't seem to accept my ""no."" I don't want to tell my son that he can't be friends with the neighbor boy, but I don't want my son going to their house or anywhere alone with either the parents ever again. I appreciate that every household is different and that differences aren't a bad thing, but these are just not the type of people that my husband and I feel comfortable sending our 9 year old with. I'm open to further play dates in neutral locations, but I don't want to become a free babysitter, and I'm never going to be comfortable with sending my son over to her house without me or his dad there.

He locked himself in the toilet after I took away his phone and Nintendo switch. I admit that I was tough on him when I first saw what he did. He came from a football practice this morning and I told him to take a shower before he‚Äôs allowed to play his games, reluctantly he went in but came out dry again after 15 min. So I touched his arms and back and instantly knew that he didn‚Äôt take a shower at all. So he got mad and slammed the doors and went into the bathroom again when I told him to go back. When he finally came out he was wet this time so I hugged him and told him that he did well and could play now. It wasn‚Äôt until I later went into the bathroom that I saw what he had left for me, not only did he smear it all over the toothbrush bristles, he put it right back in the cup with all the families toothbrushes as well. I don‚Äôt understand why he would do this and how do I deal with this accordingly because my first instinct was to punish him since I was abused as a child but I don‚Äôt want him to get scarred for life. He won‚Äôt talk to me now when I ask why he did this. Edit: football/soccer He doesn‚Äôt feel strongly about the football practice because it‚Äôs an open practice for all the kids in the area during the summer.

431,I never thought this would be the purpose of bell training my dog.,"So over the last year and abit before baby got here we have been bell training our dog to ring the bell everytime he needs to go to the toilet or wants to go outside. Within months he had a firm grasp on it so a year later he is a pro. But nowadays the purpose of the bell has changed. He is great with baby now, baby is a week old today. Still not a fan of baby crying(who is?) But all in all he is good with baby even when crying for the most part. However now when baby cries to much and it gets to much for him he rings his bell. I have never seen a dog smack a bell so hard to the point its half broken now and expected to be imbedded in the floor within a week. His face has ""get me outta here"" written all over it. If I take to long he will do a spin(a reset i presume) and start smacking it again. Within 2 minutes he wants back in. So the lesson I've learnt the last few days from my dog is that sometimes it's good to have a break and reset, even if only a couple of minutes. I hope this brings some joy to those who may be struggling and even those who are natural pros at this point. Everyone stay safe and keep doing a terrific job.",,False,False,parenting

We have until this summer to use them and the tickets must be in the names of the original passengers (me, my husband, and the two children). We are about to book a flight to Hawaii for four/five days in July and the kids are very excited! To fly to Hawaii, we must provide a negative Covid test within 24 hours of the flight, regardless of vaccination status. The rules for the resort are that to eat at the restaurants, you must present either a vaccine card or a negative test from a ""trusted partner"" within 48 hours. Depending on the places we go, other activities/restaurants may require the same. My stepdaughter (14) refuses to be vaccinated. She's the only one. With this policy, we will have to take time out of the vacation to go get a Covid test for her. My husband is very annoyed with her for refusing to get vaccinated from a public health perspective and this is the final straw for him. He says that if she wants to make this difficult for all of us, she can just stay home. I really want all of us to go together, but I can see his point that if she's refusing to follow the rules and be selfish, she can't do fun activities with the rest of us. What would you do here? ETA: We share custody with her biological mother. She could stay with her mom without any issue E2: Her biological mother is antivax and supports her not being vaccinated.

She used to come over every weekend because her mother had custody during the week. We tried to be a part of her life as much as we could, even when her mother had her, but with our kids, it was very busy. She struggled with the arrangement, but definitely internalized it because she was very well behaved. When her mother died as a senior, she came to live with us full-time When she went to college, things changed. She seemed to be anxious when she came home on school holidays and was distant.

I used to tell myself that you just didn‚Äôt want to be a dad, but that was just not true after Nick was born. Then I tried to rationalize my feelings saying that maybe you did not want a daughter, which Is why you wanted to be with him all the time, but not me. When Vanessa was born, I saw how much you loved her and thought that maybe I was a problem. As I entered high school, I tired so hard to impress you‚Äîtaking all the hardest classes and doing well, being involved in soccer because you loved soccer, and having a job. It never seemed to be enough. When I went to college, and met my friends, it felt more like home than it ever felt with you. I have struggled with my feelings with self-love and its affected a lot of my relationships and thats when I started seeing the therapist at school. I love you very much and want you to be happy, but it hurts that I was never a part of your life the way your other kids were. Please give me space."" My husbands heart has been broken, and I have been upset too. She still speaks to our kids. We had no idea she felt this way, and miss her.

436,I figured out what the worst part of being a parent is.,"The worst part about being a parent are the pets. You know what I'm talking about, little Jimmy wants a fish, he's excited and you make ""the deal"". ""Oh Jimmy, if you learn all about this fish, promise to be responsible""...... Next thing you know, YOU have a fish. Then you get attached to the fish because little Jimmy wasn't doing jack all with the upkeep and now your a few hundred bucks in since you had to get the fish back to being a healthy fish. The fish is now your best buddy, you sit down every night and spend time talking with the fish, you clean his tank and buy his special fishy treats. You fucking love this fish, it's the kid you always wanted and the dog you never had. Then one day out of the blue you come home from work and the fish is dead. No one else in the house understands why your so upset about ""just a fish"". No one understands that the fish was your BFF or how much time and energy you put into the fish so he could be the best fish in the whole fishy world. Edit: Thank you all for the kind words, it feels kinda dumb to get attached to a fish or lizard or rat or ferret.

But before the spoon could reach his mouth, my toddler jumps on me, causing all the rice and stuff to go all over my legs, the couch and the floor. He lands on the floor, dazed. I just felt this surge of anger rise up and in those few seconds, I remember all the shame and sadness I felt as a kid when my mom would scold me for being clumsy, or breaking something. That anger kind of just vanished. I swallowed really hard and said ""hey kiddo are you ok? Let's clean this up. I know it was an accident."" An hour later, when my husband handed me my infant for bedtime, he told me "" hey, I saw how you handled it. That was really good, mama."" Honestly I was almost in tears just hearing the validation from my husband. Growing up, my parents yelled at me a lot, and spanked me as well. I never want to subject my child to that, but it takes a lot of effort to stay calm and composed. My husband is naturally calm, so I model after him a lot. Not sure what I want to say.

My daughter splutters and chokes if my milk comes out too fast (her lips go blue and it‚Äôs honestly terrifying!) and my boobs hurt so much in between feeds. She also doesn‚Äôt seem to feed for so long with breast feeding because she‚Äôs getting frustrated with the choking I guess? (compared to the bottle that my husband gives her when he‚Äôs on dad duty) so she doesn‚Äôt go as long between feeds. What am I doing wrong?! I‚Äôm reluctant to give up because if my milk dries up, I won‚Äôt get it back but I‚Äôm drowning. Help!!! Edit: thanks for all your thoughtful, helpful, encouraging replies and advice.

She said she wanted to go to Bath and Body Works. I thought that was an odd request. Of course I want to give her everything, but simple fact is we can't afford a whole lot. Most kids probably want phones, electronics, games....etc. Not her. She wants candles, lotions and perfumes. P and mochis. I have no idea what those are. Now we don't have a lot of money to spend, but I want to give her the world. I looked into the little bag my wife bought and I said to her, ""That's not enough for a birthday present."" And felt very bad for my daughter.  I was actually embarrassed and ashamed to give it to her. I didn't want to see the disappointment on her face. We bought her a little $5 cake and ice cream from Wal Mart. Sang happy birthday and I held my breathe when we gave her the present. OMG. I was shocked at her reaction. She was over the moon with joy. Absolutely loved the lotion and perfume but was SOOO THRILLED with the hand sanitizer she could attach to her backpack!  Yes. Hand sanitizer. Apparently it's super popular at school. My heart was relieved but filled with love at how truly grateful she was for what she got. So I was humbled by her. I must be doing something right.

Sorry in advance for the long post, the TLDR is definitely in the title. Anyway, 14 months ago I had the most beautiful, intelligent, and strong 1lb 14oz little girl. This was incredibly traumatic because she was born 3 months early and the both of us were in really rough shape. I almost died shortly after my C-section due to my liver rupturing and spent a few weeks in ICU. I didn‚Äôt even get to hold my baby until she was 3.5 weeks old. She had an even harder go of it and spent 6 long months battling for her life in the NICU. We as a family went through hell and back dealing with ventilators, 6 surgeries, hospital transfers, tons of different specialists, breast milk drying up before being able to physically breastfeed her, driving over 3 hours total each day to and from the hospital, working full time, etc. All of this on top of the continuing pandemic. She is doing much better now, but still behind on some things and we are working on them. She is still followed by that large team of specialists too and seems to really be thriving. Thankfully, she is breathing without oxygen, which is better than a lot of other premies, but she does have chronic lung disease which puts her at high risk for respiratory diseases. Queue the pandemic, and more specifically, the delta variant. We have been working so hard to keep her healthy. There is family that she still hasn‚Äôt met and the close family/friends that have met her have done so outside and with masks. Now that it is getting colder though, that is becoming harder to do so for Thanksgiving we invited nuclear family, which is still a decent size due to siblings and spouses. I made it clear that we would love to celebrate with them, but that we would do so safely and that anyone who wanted to come needed to be fully vaccinated (hence the reason for sending out the invite so far in advance, dad and I have been vaccinated since March). Most were supportive, but one family member in particular refuses and called today to argue the point. I love him and want to see him, but we have come too far, been through too much,  and I am not willing to risk my child‚Äôs health over something so dumb as his stubbornness to not get the vaccine. I‚Äôm tired fighting everyone, I‚Äôm sick of people being selfish, I just want to get back to normal. I‚Äôm so so tired of being so anxious about everything that I can‚Äôt sleep anymore.

457,You don't stop becoming a parent when you become a grandparent,"I am not a grandparent. My kids are toddlers. So the comments calling me a boomer, justnomil, and a ‚Äúselfish hag,‚Äù etc. are not only unnecessary, they are inaccurate. ‚Ä¶right? I'm shocked at how many posts I'm seeing about people upset about ""sharing"" Mother's Day with other mothers in their lives. Once you have a child, you are a mother for the rest of your life. Just because a mother becomes a grandmother doesn't magically mean she is no longer a mother. I imagine that, years from now, when our own children have children, we will still consider ourselves their parents - even if we are grandparents to their children. All parents should be allowed to participate in celebrating their respective parents' days. It is not weird or annoying for an older mother to want to see their children on Mother's Day. No one parent is ""more deserving"" than another by default of having had kids more recently, in my opinion. If you argue that, you could argue that a mom who has been a mom longer deserves to be celebrated more because they have been through more shit. lol (Of course there are exceptions where people don't want to celebrate with abusive/narcistic/etc. family members or their spouse being a blockhead and not communicating and/or celebrating properly. This is not about that.) Edit: a lot of comments and I can‚Äôt keep up, but I see a lot of the same. Obviously, my perspective differs from a lot of other peoples‚Äô here. And that‚Äôs ok, generating conversations is cool anyway. I‚Äôm not implying that mothers of newborns should pack up and travel hours to go see anyone. I‚Äôm not saying that new moms should drop everything to cater to all the women in their lives. I‚Äôm just saying that my Own opinion is that Mother‚Äôs Day is for all the moms, and a dismissive ‚Äúgrandparents day is in September‚Äù is a strange way to look at celebrating all moms. I do think there‚Äôs something special about a first Mother‚Äôs Day, but I don‚Äôt personally think the length of time someone has been a mom makes them more deserving of celebrating. Also another edit, my kids are toddlers and I‚Äôm not a grandparent, since that was a point of confusion I guess Just want to say thanks to everyone who was respectful even if they disagree ‚ù£Ô∏è hope all of you who are celebrating this weekend have a good Mother‚Äôs Day!",,False,False,parenting

459,My daughter is being harassed by a ‚Äúspecial needs‚Äù student in her class everyday,"I want to be as sensitive as I can with this topic, and I‚Äôm going to try and explain everything in the best way I can without being insensitive. My daughter is 4 years old (almost 5) and in pre-kindergarten. She‚Äôs a little more advanced for her age range, and is also very understanding of others. She‚Äôs pretty shy at school, but her teacher tells us she always follows directions, has 2 close friends in class, and is always respectful and kind to others. We‚Äôve not had one issue with her and only positive feedback. However, our daughter has been telling us something completely different. Everyday we ask how school was, and she always says great. Then, last week she told us a student in her class  pushed her in the library while she was reading. She said she knew it was on purpose, so she got up and moved tables away from him so he couldn‚Äôt push her again, and that she tried to tell the teacher but the teacher didn‚Äôt hear her (she can be meek at times). It was really upsetting to hear, but I only let it slide because I know how 4 year olds are, especially a large amount of them under the eye of one overworked teacher. Then, the next day she said the same student threw chairs in class and started throwing things off the teachers desk, and she was somewhat upset/worried about it. The next day, she tells us that the same kid pinched her intentionally. She said she moved away from him and told her teacher and again, nothing happened. The next day the same student is yelling cuss words at everyone in class, my daughter is a little upset. They have Friday off, so nothing that day. Then yesterday the same type of behavior. Now to today, my fianc√© picked her up and she immediately told him that the student had lifted up her shirt. I was, and still am livid. First thing, all the incidents that are happening with this student are being relayed by my daughter, including when he physically did something to her. Her teacher has not said a word to us, even though she has told her teacher that he‚Äôs hurt her/ the things he does worry her. Including the incident today, the teacher said nothing, instead our daughter told us. Second, I put special needs in quotations because when my fianc√© asked the teacher about what‚Äôs going on, she simply said the student has an IEP. Our daughter has pointed the student out to us, so we know what he looks like. At this point we aren‚Äôt sure what to do. I will not stand for what happened today. Our daughter also said the only thing the teacher did was tell the student to say ‚Äúsorry.‚Äù My daughter loves school but everyday now she‚Äôs been harassed by this kid, and having her shirt pulled up infront of other students is embarrassing and unacceptable. Should we reach out to the teacher or do we go to the principal?

When I say a lot, I mean this girl lived with us during quarantine for 4 months, spends every weekend with us, and probably 2 nights a week. I have become very close with her and consider her part of the family. She has had a pretty traumatic life in her short 14 years, and her home life is not great. In the 18 months I have known her,  she has grown to trust me and confided in me quite a bit. She told me recently that her older brother, age 18, has been violently raping her for several years now. It happens several times a week, and that is part of why she tries to stay away from her house as much as she can. I struggled with myself for a bit because I didn't want her to feel I had betrayed her confidence, but knew I had to report it and get her out of there. I made the call yesterday. Her mom hasn't asked her any questions, immediately believed the brother and claims she is lying to get attention and start drama.

My kids are worried and upset about their friends obviously as any teen would be. I am a bit concerned that the retaliation may not stop with this...to my knowledge the brother hasn't been arrested yet and the mom has a clear vendetta about me reporting her son.

I blocked and deleted his contact information and had a conversation with his mother we‚Äôre she proceeded to tell me that my 7 year old needs to grow some balls. I told her that there is some behavior that should not be tolerated.

I‚Äôve been wanting to ask for advice for a long time but I‚Äôve been putting it off because this subject makes me stressed and depressed just thinking about it. My 14 year old daughter has completely neglected her hygiene and refuses to go to school. She‚Äôs been wearing the same clothes for months and hasn‚Äôt bathed/showered in over 6 or 7 months. Last time I asked for advice everyone told me that she needs to go to therapy. So I encouraged her to get therapy (I gave her money so she‚Äôd agree) and she did talking therapy over the phone for a few weeks then stopped. So I kind of gave up. She‚Äôs on her phone and computer 24/7 and refuses to communicate. The only time she leaves her room is when she wants food. Today she came to pick her plate (she eats in her room) and she literally looked and smelled like a homeless person. Her clothes are so filthy and warn out that they‚Äôve become baggy and crusty. I tried to start a conversation with her and I asked her if she wants me to buy her new clothes and she said ‚Äúno, that‚Äôs a waste of money‚Äù then left.

We talked and she told me she gets mistreated at her moms house. She gets grounded and yelled at for every little thing over there. So then I told my ex that my daughter will be staying with me for a while. Her boyfriend calls my daughter and tells her ‚Äúlet us know if you‚Äôre not coming home and we‚Äôll pack your shit‚Äù.

469,Perks of Parenthood: Fulfilling my own childish desires,"Yesterday, I [27M] used my status as guardian over my half-sister [5F] to fulfill a longtime childhood dream: I went to Color Me Mine. For the longest time, I have always wanted to go but never felt like I could because I was a boy. A bit sexist, yes, but it was always how I felt growing up and, while I don't condone those ideals any more, its just a little uncomfortable going alone. When I was a kid, the boys I would play with always derided it as a girly activity and no one would go with me. As a teenager, my friends would rather we loiter by the video game store, comic book stop, movie theatre and food court, etc when we'd go to the mall. Never at Color Me Mine like I secretly wanted. Then, as an adult, I never felt comfortable going alone and my friends were more interested in getting drunk or going to a bar. But no longer. Ever since I adopted my sister, the weekends have been slotted for fun and varied activities. So far, we've been to a football game, hiked, biking through the hills, gardened our backyard, miniature golfed, so on and so on. I don't get to see my sister except for in the mornings before I drop her off and in the evening after work, so I try to make our full days more interesting and safely get her out of her comfort zone so she can better understand what she likes and doesn't like. She's a little angel and is really adventurous and clever. But, yesterday, I fully decided that our trip to the mall would have a detour to Color Me Mine. Honestly, I don't think she knew what it was until I explained it right outside the store, but she seemed like she'd just go with the flow. So we entered and I felt like a giddy little kid again. My sister seemed ambivalent towards it but she seemed like she had fun. She painted a ceramic of an owl shades of pink and blue and I, still keeping up the facade of the parent being led into the store by their child, painted a green and yellow plate. She was really focused on her design and I was just happy to be here. So happy that after my plate, I picked out a Stegosaur to paint with my sister. We decided to make it blue with red accents. After we were done, I asked her if she liked it and she said it was okay and didn't give it another thought. Which is fine, as beyond my ulterior motives, I had been trying to balance our activities with more artistic ones. For me, personally, it was fun. Didn't live up to the hype I drummed up in my head but I enjoyed it a lot and I was happy to have finally done it. Much appreciation for my sister for helping me fulfill my secret and nefarious goals. Does anyone else secretly get to indulge in childish desires because of their little ones?",,False,False,parenting
470,Daycare complaining keeping my kid home is causing staffing issues. How?,"So, I pay for full time daycare and our contract says our drop off time is 8am. However, my job has been very flexible so I can go in later and enjoy more time with my son IF I don't have a client meeting. However, the daycare is complaining that me dropping my son off later is causing staffing issues. I always pick my son up at the same time when they close. They asked that we let them know what time drop off will be for each day because it is causing staffing issues. I am working this in my head trying to find a reason this would cause staffing issues at all. I am paying for full time day care. The only 2 logical explanations I can think of is that they are already understaffed and moving caregivers to other rooms after drop off time (where no parents will see the shortage) , or that my drop off time is screwing with their lunch schedules... But with the lunch schedule thing the person could take lunch at the same time and it wouldn't affect whether the floating caregiver was watching 4 babies or 3. I paid for the time and am choosing not to use it. Why would they complain they have less babies to watch? Someone set me straight because I must be missing something.",,False,False,parenting
471,My mom criticized me setting boundaries with my son‚Ä¶and I had a revelation,"TLDR; I set boundaries with my son, my mom said it made me a bad parent. But I now realize she had taught me that setting boundaries is bad (and I have trouble setting them) through her own actions and I‚Äôm breaking that cycle. Woohoo. So I have been creating boundaries with my son (3.5yo). Sometimes I get touched out and it causes a sensory overload so I have to ask for space or excuse myself from the room and ask my son to play (somewhere else). I would never hurt my son, but I do feel irritated feeling/anger/overstimulation building inside me and sometimes I burst and yell at which I‚Äôm trying not to do. I feel like this is a common thing for parents to experience though. I told my mom this (I think she heard me asking for space when I was on the phone). He was climbing on top of me since I was playing on the ground with my infant and I felt that bubbling urge to yell so I asked if he could please get off me, something to the effect of ‚Äúhey bud, can you please stop jumping on me? Mommy doesn‚Äôt want to be jumped on right now‚Äù and he started crying because he doesn‚Äôt know how to regulate emotions super well and I excused myself into the bathroom where I don‚Äôt let my son follow me. My mom was on the phone with me during this whole thing and said something to the effect of how I was being mean or I should let him play with me and I‚Äôm his only friend (I‚Äôm a 99% of the time sahm so he doesn‚Äôt get much socialization). So I shouldn‚Äôt tell him to leave me alone or get off of me. Full stop. I was thinking about this situation all morning and had a revelation. My mom basically taught me my entire life (through her own actions and inadvertently like in this conversation) that my boundaries are ‚Äúunfair‚Äù to other people. No wonder I literally struggle setting boundaries in ALL relationships in my life. So I told her during this conversation that I am more than allowed to set boundaries with my child and it doesn‚Äôt make me a bad mom. I am still a human who has needs and, honestly, I think it makes me a better mom than her because I‚Äôm teaching him that it‚Äôs okay to not be okay with something and express that emotion. It also helps me calm down my overstimulation so I don‚Äôt yell. Anywho, I just had to tell someone this because I feel like I just had a therapy session in my own head. hahah, go childhood trauma.

I'm a little concerned because I don't know how healthy that would be and my wife is thinking primarily in aesthetics. Her hair won't necessarily darken, I'm an adult and have light blonde the same as when I was a kid. But my wife had that same color when she was little and her hair was brown by the time she was a pre-teen. She haven't tried anything yet but wants to talk to her cousin (who's a hairdresser) to find what they can do. My wife thinks I'm being silly and that will help our daughter because she won't have to keep dyeing her roots when she's older but I'm not fully aboard with the idea of putting something in my daughter's rotine for years because of something that doesn't really affects her life. It's not a major thing right now, but I want opinions. EDIT: Many comments about the possible damage to my daughter's hair and scalp. I'd just like to add that her mother would NEVER do anything knowing it will harm our daughter.

That moment was the LAST TIME she'll care enough about her doll to hold it like that. She's outgrowing it, and to me it's so fucking tragic.

Years ago, I was always super sad about telling my wife ""you know one day I'll put her down after carrying her and never really pick her back up again.""

We dim the lights, heat up some sake (good stuff that a restaurant would normally charge like $50 a bottle but only costs like $15-20 in a store), and just enjoy each other's company while we eat. It's not the same vibe as going out, but honestly, it's a nice change to the routine and I highly recommend it to any parents out there who just need some time together.

This morning I ran out of patience, we had been playing most of the morning and I had to stop to do some chores in the kitchen. He got frustrated by this and threatened to hit me with a role of paper. It's a solid role about 2 inches think and not something I wanted to be hit with, but the act and threat alone was enough.

So he hit me as I walked away and then screamed and balled his eyes out and begged me to stop as I threw it in the recycling...and I can't stop thinking about it..he was distraught. Did I do the right thing? Am I going about this the wrong way? I could feel myself boiling over when he hit me so I didn't even hesitate but now I've cooled off I feel foolish. He's not really seen me get angry so me getting so quiet and visibly frustrated may have contributed to his upset. EDIT. Just to clarify as it's come up a few times. When I threw the paper away I was furious. I took it from him, walked out and threw it into thr recycling and walked back in without looking at or acknowledging my son in anyway.

This isn't the first time either. We paid for a party room at an arcade style place, confirmed with parents ahead of time, baked cupcakes, had party favor bags ready to go... And then sat there in an empty room just waiting. The place was nice enough to lower the cost for us at the end, but it's really not about money. My daughter was so gracious about the whole thing and just had fun playing games and riding rides with her dad, sister and me. We even went to Target after and let her pick out another gift. Some families cancelled due to covid issues, recent exposures and such which I can understand (and heck even appreciate) but there were some that texted me 20 mins into party time saying they couldn't make it. One didn't even bother to let me know at all. These are long term friends, school friends, sports friends. People who's parties we've attended, hang out with fairly regularly (we're both full time workers on top of parenting, so not a lot of free time but we make an effort) all of whom, again, confirmed they were coming. We don't have a large extended family so no cousins to invite at all. To the ""this isn't the first time"" part, my older daughter's birthday party last August was the exact same scenario, except it was a pool party at home instead of an arcade. The years prior to covid had a very small turnout for both kid's parties (obviously we didn't even try for parties in 2020 or early 2021), like 3-4 friends which was fine with us! That would've been fine today, too. We try to be accommodating, knowing that some parents are in a rough spot financially. We expressly state on the invites that gifts aren't expected, I've offered to help with rides if someone needs it, we just want friends to help us celebrate. My kids are good to their friends, they give so much love and kindness. I hear from other parents and teachers how well they get along with their friends. How sweet they are, how willing to help and be there for others. So what gives? Has anyone else experienced this? Am I doing something wrong? Do I just give up on this kind of birthday party and try to find some other way to celebrate? I'm at a loss. TLDR: My kid's birthday parties are regularly a complete disappointment, in that no one shows up. My kids aren't monsters, we try to be as conscious and accommodating as possible, we know and have good relationships with most of our invitees (some are just school friends, but still). We try to do everything right. The reasons for not showing vary from covid stuff (those are completely understandable) to no reason at all because they didn't even call or text.

He did not tell me yet about this (probably because he knows I could not afford to buy him a new one), but I realized it myself when I often saw him struggle to turn his phone on. I am enraged but I have not confronted him yet as I ran out of ways to approach him calmly because none ever worked. Please, please send your advice or thoughts on this matter. [Edit: I wanted to clarify two things about this post: (1) I may have incorrectly used 'enraged'. I'm just upset and disappointed about what happened and chose not to confront him yet because I could feel his guilt (as he never brought it up to me himself) and I don't want to make him feel worse. (2) I meant that his anger towards people and stuff are often released through punching/breaking things around the house, but this only happens when he is in severe distress, which is seldom. I believe it is true that restricting his access to gadgets will not solve the underlying problem (his anger management issues). I had considered brigning him to therapy, but I kept dismissing the thought for some reason. And since many of you stressed it enough that he badly needs it, I must and I will take him to therapy. I've read every single comment through and through, and I appreciate all of your advice and insights. I have realized some things I should and should not do as a parent. I actually feel bad I could not respond to each of you and thank you individually. But, hey, thanks so much for helping me out. All the best.]",,False,False,parenting
490,"You Work Hard, Do Your Best, Help Everyone, And Get Screamed At By Your Wife","I‚Äôm the SAHD who does at minimum 95% of all parenting and home front duties: cleaning, cooking, food shopping, errands, maintenance, everything. My wife works full time at a stressful job. We happily did everything she wanted for Mother‚Äôs Day today. We didn't leave as early as she wanted to, but you know what? We had a relaxing morning. She was happy. My kids were happy. They were enjoying the morning together and my kids were giving her Mother's Day cards the had made yesterday and then they made her some more. I cooked breakfast for everyone and helped with everything. But of course my wife's complaint was that we didn't leave early enough. Our trip entailed driving almost two hours each way for an outing and a playground for the kids and getting food for us in a special place where we don't usually go. The day went smoothly. We got home in one piece. I‚Äôm exhausted of course. At the end of the night, my wife is exhausted and wants to go to bed. That's fine. I'm exhausted too, always am pretty much, but that's OK. My 18 month old had two naps in the car since we drove so much (what my wife wanted to do; I would have gone somewhere that involved half the driving) and my 4 y/o who doesn‚Äôt nap had a nap in the car. My 6 y/o goes to bed late anyway. This is what I hate about my wife. Instead of just honestly saying to me, ‚ÄúLook, we had a great day but I‚Äôm exhausted and I know the kids slept a lot in the car, but I‚Äôm fading fast here and if you could help get them to sleep I‚Äôd be so appreciative,‚Äù she gets super pissed off very quickly, yelling at me multiple times to come in and fix everything (she cannot do anything really), telling me to shut the kitchen light off. I had gotten milk for one of the kids and the kitchen light was already off and had been for awhile. I told her this. Of course I was right and so she said nothing. Whenever she does this ‚Äî says statements that aren‚Äôt factually true and I simply state the fact, refuting her BS, she says nothing. Ever. Never ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre right,‚Äù or ‚ÄúOh, my bad.‚Äù Just zero. She is an intelligent person, so she must know I'm right when I say, ""The kitchen light is already off."" She could visually see it was off from where she was. She's a total narcissist. The kids were being a bit rambunctious as my wife was trying to get to sleep. Of course, they weren't instantly cooperating because two of them weren't tired enough to just go to sleep at that point. After demanding I take the kids more than once (as if I can just magically pick up all three kids and we all vanish into another room in silence) and as I‚Äôm trying my best to corral them and control the situation, my wife yells at me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ruining Mother‚Äôs Day!‚Äù I was doing my best.

491,SAHD who likes to relax during personal time. Wife annoyed.,"I am a SAHD to two beautiful daughters under five. I absolutely love my ‚Äòjob‚Äô and would not trade it for the world. When I get ‚Äòfree‚Äô time, I like to spend some of it playing video games or going for a hike. I need to for my own sanity. I don‚Äôt see it as selfish, rather as regenerative so that I can be more present with my kids. This time is limited to mornings and night before and after kids sleep. We also ‚Äòtrade‚Äô time where one of us takes the kids for an hour or two, then we switch. As I said above, I use this time for my hobbies. My wife will occasionally take a bath or do a hobby, but she often uses that time to do laundry or do some housework that is usually my job. I appreciate it, but try to tell her it is unnecessary. She often says how tired she is and I wish she would just take a bath or a nap. I think that I do a good but not great job keeping the house clean and picked up, but I prefer to wait to do dishes until there are a few things there, for example. Anyway, this morning I woke up, had a shower, then sat down to have my coffee and play a few games of Rocket League. My wife saw this on her way to work and called me to say I should be spending this time doing laundry or some other chore. Our laundry was caught up other than a few minor loads that I was planning to do today. I have two questions here - 1: How can I better encourage my wife to chill a bit for her own good, short of always having every chore done the moment it comes up? My wife can be quite anxious and has some childhood issues with being ‚Äògood enough‚Äô. 2: She really wants a third kid and I‚Äôm not really that into it but have decided to give in and go along because I love her and want her to have her dream. I said that my condition is that I want to maintain enough personal time as we are just emerging from young toddler stage and a baby means reentering that wonderful little hell üòë. I‚Äôll be okay but I think this is part of her annoyance with me. She is already so tired but also so badly wants a third child.

Now on multiple occasions I have had to have a hard conversation with my daughters father (who was beat daily within an inch of his life by his mother growing up) mulple times after he slaps her hand when she hits.

Maybe taking a trip with three kids (10, 4, 9 months) was the not bright. Maybe my husband and I just love exhaustion and drama and cleaning out sand from little kid shorts. Alright so- heads up and listen to the shitshow The week before we even left my 10 year old accidentally smashed his iPad, my parents dog died, my baby started cutting her two front teeth, and we all got a headcold. We should‚Äôve trusted the major red flags saying ‚Äúhey maybe don‚Äôt go out of town for a week and maybe instead stay home and rest for a minute instead‚Äù but no. We are dumb. We get down there after an 8 hour trip with a screaming baby who loathes her carseat, a very bored tween, and a four year old who has been strapped down for too long and now has the energy of a thousand Great Danes with the zoomies. Bonus points, everyone is hangry. It now takes SIX HOURS for the condo to figure out what the fuck is going on with why they can‚Äôt find the key. Then they found the key. Then the key didn‚Äôt work. The they called someone to make a new key. Then that key didn‚Äôt work. Then he came out, made ANOTHER, and we got in 8 hours after our arrival time. Thank god I‚Äôm a human milk tap or my baby would‚Äôve never made it. Unfortunately my two older kids were not amused. Side note: they ate an entire case of chips ahoy cookies while waiting because cookies were they only tool I had on hand to pass the time. We get in the condo. Which hasn‚Äôt been cleaned. Try to switch rooms. Can‚Äôt cause we accidentally booked a condo at a resort where everyone is a moron. Including us. Cue day two, my brothers family arrives. My kids were so excited to play with theirs. But alas, drama comes with them. They leave within in 24 hours, (after leaving their kids with us four times to go do whatever they wanted) because my sister in law suddenly decides she doesn‚Äôt want to stay. Their kids cry. My kids cry. It was a doozy. The rest of the week consisted of me and my husband frantically running around slathering children with sunscreen, endlessly cleaning sand off of everyone, fixing everyone‚Äôs meals, worrying about nap times, and trying to let our kids make obliviously happy memories while trying to not throw ourselves into the ocean in defeat.

494,Nobody coming to my son‚Äôs birthday party,"Update: we ended up getting 3 affirmative RSVP‚Äôs from my son‚Äôs old class. He passed out invitations in his new class on Thursday, and has already gotten 3 affirmative RSVP‚Äôs from there. If nobody else comes, that‚Äôs just fine because six kids is a fantastic number. I did take the advice of the people in this sub and changed venues. We moved it from an indoor location, I rented a pavilion at a nearby park and we‚Äôre having it there instead. I really appreciate all the advice! I‚Äôve always felt horrible when I read about this happening to a kid, and never imagined it would happen to mine. Literally EVERY time a kid in his class invited him to their birthday party, we went, even if it meant rearranging our schedule, for exactly that reason. Then it was his turn to hand out invitations- not a single RSVP. He‚Äôs turning six and thinks he‚Äôs having a big party with ‚Äúall my friends.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm crushed. To be fair, there‚Äôs still time, but I‚Äôd think someone would‚Äôve replied by now if anyone was coming. Instilling kindness was so important to me, this would be a SUPER long post if I shared the lengths I went to in order to help him understand the importance of inclusion and bucket filling. To look for the kid nobody is playing with. To speak to the kid even if s/he is nonverbal. To say hi to the kid who looks different from him. My child is the person who, when he was told by two classmates that he couldn‚Äôt play with them and that he‚Äôs fat, went home and made/decorated them construction paper hearts, hoping it would make them like him. It didn‚Äôt. I was so busy teaching him how to be inclusive that I didn‚Äôt consider giving him the tools to cope with being the one who‚Äôs excluded. He‚Äôs just so sensitive and this will break his heart if nobody comes. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. He‚Äôs in a different class now, but I‚Äôm not sure anyone from this class  would come to his party considering they just met. Sorry, this is mostly just a rant. My heart is very heavy tonight. Edit: I really appreciate all the replies, and have never gotten so many notifications and messages. I‚Äôm probably never going to be able to reply to them all but wanted to express appreciation and make a clarification. My son is going to have a great birthday. He‚Äôs got no shortage of loving family members who will celebrate him and make him feel special, and he will get plenty of great presents. He just doesn‚Äôt have any friends and that made me sad. I REALLY appreciate all the offers to get him a gift, it really warmed my heart, but I think that kind of generosity is better used on a kid who‚Äôs got less resources at his/her disposal, and I apologize if I made it sound like he wouldn‚Äôt have anything at all. The offers for cards I‚Äôd gladly accept, as they‚Äôre a token of friendship and support, and I don‚Äôt know anyone who doesn‚Äôt need that. I‚Äôm going to invite the kids from his class and see if there‚Äôs interest. If there isn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm going to cancel his party, tell him covid shut it down, and take him on a special trip to Chicago to see the aquarium/lego store, or to a hotel with an indoor water park. If it comes to that, the fact that nobody was coming to his party is something he will never know. I just am hopeful kids from his new class will come. Edit #2: we got an RSVP! I was upfront with the mom and said so far she was the only one, that I was concerned the indoor venue was the issue, and that I was thinking about moving it to an outdoor park. She thought that was a good idea and was on board, so we‚Äôre going to move forward with that plan and focus on inviting the kids in his new class, and will ask his teacher to update the parents in his old class in case anyone planned on coming and just didn‚Äôt RSVP. I would hate for someone to show up for a party and not know we‚Äôd moved locations. I appreciate all the positive input and support!",,False,False,parenting

496,My boyfriend's grandma thinks she can get visitation to see my newborn baby WITHOUT ME,"So I'm posting this here mostly because this situation amuses me at how terribly ridiculous it is. Long story short my boyfriend's grandma has never liked me. She keeps him closer than a grandma should a grandchild and their relationship closely  resembles that of family emeshment. We had a falling out because we went to a sunflower and mum festival with other family members and couldn't pick her up because we were already picking them up. I haven't had to deal with her for months because she thinks I'm controlling and manipulative towards her grandson because he's gone to her for relationship advice in the past when I was pregnant. She even tried to block communication between us by blocking my number and family on his phone and told each of us the other didn't want to talk to each other. She also has been telling him she's going to seek custody and visitation to rights since I was 7 months pregnant. Our baby is now here (he arrived last week) and she's seeking to go through with this matter. She was upset HE didn't invite her to the hospital while I was in labor/after our child was born. It has now been one week and she keeps proclaiming she ""will die before she sees her great grandchild."" I was feeling empathetic and offered for us to bring him over to visit, but of course she did not respond. She also never seemed interested when I attempted to share ultrasound pictures and updates while I was pregnant to be nice. So now she is upset at my SO for not offering to bring our EBF baby over to see her without me. She's gone out of her way to buy baby a swing and 2 outfits that are ""ONLY"" for him while he's staying at her house. Any one else have to go through a similar situation as this? It seems pretty crazy, but at this point I'm done reaching out. I'm done being mad about it and I choose to laugh.

However, while my mom was giving the kids a bath in the next room, my stepdad brought the guns out and demostrated how his laser worked on one of them by pointing it at my neice's face.

512,Divorced parents: does the non-custodial parent come over to do things like bedtime?,"My husband (34M) and I (32F) are most likely getting divorced. He has said that once we don‚Äôt live together anymore, he plans to still come over and have dinner with us and put the kids to bed every night (they‚Äôre 4 years old and 2 months old). I told him that the point of divorce is for us to maintain separate households; we either stay together as a family unit or split into two. I‚Äôve never been divorced, nor were my parents, but none of my friends with divorced parents had the non-custodial parent come over to make dinner and put them to bed every night. It‚Äôs just not how it works. He says that this is spiteful of me, but I say it‚Äôs just the reality of divorce. My time with the kids is mine, and his time with them is his. If we aren‚Äôt married I don‚Äôt have any obligation to even let him into my house. If he wants to spend every evening with his kids then we have to stay married. Things like birthday parties and other special occasions are one thing, but my understanding is that when you divorce and your spouse takes primary custody of your kids, you kind of give up the day-to-day things like dinner and bedtime. I could be way off base here, but wouldn‚Äôt it actually make things more difficult on them in the long run, to have their dad come over and put them to bed but not live with them? Wouldn‚Äôt that give them false hope that we‚Äôll get back together? We already agreed that for their stability I would have primary custody and he would have them every other weekend (we‚Äôre still divvying up holidays); going back and forth every week would honestly be too confusing for them.

Regardless, this made my daughter uncomfortable and I completely empathize. With all of that being said, how should I handle this? I've already validated her feelings and we had a good laugh about it, but does anyone think I should take it further and talk to his dad? If so, what should I say to him?

Bonus points mom never waits for me to respond, and the multiple times I have called her, texted, and walked down to talk to her she never responds or is not home. Their 16 year old sister answers the door and tells me to try calling their mom. I have had issues with these kids and their parents in the past but this takes the whole cake.

The 10 year old was in the hospital with a broken arm. And the 10 year old is sick but it‚Äôs just allergies. During this lie fest the 8 year old starts coughing HARD like a dry bark of a cough. I kindly but firmly told the 8 year old that he is ALSO sick so he needs to go home, that my boys cannot play. The kid then lies again, by telling me he was not sick. But the real kicker was him telling me‚Ä¶ That his mom told him to tell people, that He is not sick it‚Äôs just allergies. I‚Äôm so flippin mad!

The only issue that were having now and that is really concerning to me is that she can and does sleep through him crying. And not just crying but SCREAMING... We have been taking shifts basically taking care of him at night so we both get some rest and will usually take him out of our room to console him and feed him and change him when he's fussy and waking up. We have a swing in the living room that we will let him lay in and sleep in if he seems to be a little more fussy and not showing he will sleep through the night. The thing is I am having to get him at times because he will be screaming his lungs out with her asleep not 2ft away on the couch. I will come grab him and try saying her name loudly to wake her up almost screaming myself and she won't budge until I actually shake her leg to wake her up... Then when awake ill ask if she's heard him right next to her head screaming and she says she didn't hear a thing until then when I've woken her... This would be less of an issue if I worked in town and was home everynight but my job requires me to travel for weeks at a time and I'm starting back  work next week. What can we do to help her make sure she wakes up when he's crying and in need. It terrifies me to think that I will be states away and he will be screaming and upset for any reason and she will just have no clue and sleep though it. Any advice or help would be much appreciated TLDR; Mom sleeps through baby literally screaming at night, how can we help her hear him and wake up. EDIT: This post blew up way bigger than I expected and I can't thank all of you enough that have given advice and suggestions and and shared your similar stories. We're going to look into the alert feature many of you spoke about that Apple phones have and were also checking out some monitors for deaf and hard of hearing parents! These next few days before I leave town for work I'll be taking the entire night shift to ensure she gets some extra rest before I'm gone for an extended amount of time. She's reached out the her doctor to talk about it as well and see what they suggest on a sleep study or testing for any other possible issues. Were both going to be more diligent about not letting our son sleep in his swing for an extended amount of time as well. Those that have offered words of encouragement, support and just general good vibes are so greatly appreciated also!",,False,False,parenting
542,"PSA: If you're showing up, you're winning!","Yesterday was my son's 4th birthday. Not ONE of my family members text, called or otherwise wished him a Happy Birthday. No cards. No gifts. Nothing. I recently deleted all social media (with exception to Reddit, of course) so I guess they couldn't be bothered, since no FB notifications were on their phones reminding them of their grandson/nephew/cousin's birthday. My dad did text ""Happy Birthday, Tatum"". Except, that is the wrong son. But, at least he text. We pass it off as ""welp, at least dad text"", ""at least he wished me a happy birthday, despite it being the wrong day""; essentially, ""at least he TRIED"". Because that's more than he's ever really done. The purpose of this sub-reddit is to discuss advice and what not about parenting -- typically with the parents being the authors and soliciting for that advice, suggestions or whatever. But my post is just a reminder, rant or whatever you choose to take from it. But, if you're feeling like a shit parent, but at least try and do more than my family, then know that you are a good parent. You show up. And really, that's 90% of what counts. I'm 35-years-old and here to tell you that it still hurts that my parents don't. And my ""close"" siblings really don't give a shit, either.

543,friends bag on us for our kids' sleep schedules,"Some background... My husband and I are a part of a close knit group of friends, 4 couples including us. We've been close for more than 10 years. Every person in the group is a good human being. The group has always been characterized by a tremendous amount of love and support. Us wives have a group chat and not a day goes by where we aren't messaging each other. We all adore one another's kids and the adults are all aunt and uncle so and so. Among us there are 14 kids, the youngest is 11 months, the oldest is 7. Our gatherings are wild. Anyway, since we all started popping out kids, there's been a running joke about my children's sleep schedules. There's no animosity in it, and we've never felt put off or offended by it, but I'm starting to wonder if my friends have a point. Is this schedule not age appropriate?¬† 5 y/o twins: bedtime 7:30 pm, wake up 6:30 am 3 y/o: bedtime 7 pm, wake up 7 am, nap from 1 to 3 18 m/o: bedtime 6:45 pm, wake up 6 am, nap 11 to 1 We get made fun of for how early they go to bed and how early they wake up. The other school age kids in the group (again, none older than 7) all go to bed between 9 and 9:30. I feel like that's so late for a little kid!

The caseworker saw right through the report and knew it was a lie. I was right about who reported me, the report contained a statement only the two girls heard me make. We were the only people in the room. I was told that this girl told them that I also gave my son a black eye. She then showed me the photographic evidence that her colleague sent her not even 48 hours later that showed he was unharmed. The caseworker stated that she felt uncomfortable with how the girls treated my son and asked if the gym is going to address those issues. I spoke with the regional director over the weekend (I sent a long email and got a phone call in response which wasn't lost on me, they're covering their asses so hard) and told her that we had agreed that they would retrain the whole staff on mandatory reporting and getting facts straight before reporting. The director kept implying it was a random person in the parking lot. Well now I have written proof that it was an employee. The caseworker watched the way my son hopped around and was loving with both of us, he even hugged and kissed her when she left. That's not typical of him so he must have felt really comfortable with her. Before she left, she asked for the director's contact information. Hm.  We agreed that what the reporter did was a crime and that this is a blatant false report. Our case will be closed shortly and marked unfounded. I sent a very long email to the director about the seriousness of this issue and I told her that the two women in child watch need to be interviewed over the crime that one of them committed and that the disciplinary action must reflect the seriousness of the allegations made against me. I also said that any further correspondence about this issue must be in writing. There is so much more but I don't have the energy to write it all out again. Anyway, I won, I had the truth on my side, and this girl will hopefully lose her job and never again be allowed to work in a trusted position with children.

549,I reached my breaking point and did something that I regret,"Yesterday, I made a post about how my two daughters always want dad and no matter what I do, they just want dad over me, all of the time. Sorry, I'm a still new to this and don't know how to link it. Well, today I did something that I really regret. I went into today still feeling really upset and just drained by everything. I'm pregnant (still really early) so there's hormones flying around and I was just feeling really bad. We had a lot of errands to run today so we decided to split up. Dad took the oldest and I took the youngest and we split the errands that needed doing. Of course, my youngest (3) wasn't happy at all with this and wanted to go with dad. She screamed and cried to the point that he had to fasten her in the car seat because she wouldn't let me do it. It stayed like this the whole time we were out. She kept asking for dad and throwing a tantrum all day. I tried to bribe her with sweets and gingerbread biscuits and even a toy. She was having none of it. We were in the middle of a clothing shop and I let go of her hand for a second to look at something and she ran off. I caught up with her and I told her off for running off and then came the biggest, most awful screech that I had ever heard. Everybody turned to look at us. So then she started stomping her feet and screaming that she wanted daddy. And I'd had enough by this point. It had been constant all day. I really, really wanted to just leave her there and I very nearly did. But I didn't. I dropped my basket of clothes on the floor (now my nieces and nephews don't have any christmas presents), picked her up and took her back to the car. I called my partner and asked him where he was and luckily he had just pulled up into our driveway. I drove her home, took her and all the christmas presents that I'd just bought inside, threw them on the floor and told her ""you want daddy? There he is."". Then I went upstairs and packed a bag. Came back downstairs five minutes later, told them that all they want is daddy so they got what they wanted, told them to have a good christmas and left. Told my partner that I'm not having another child just for them to hate me and turned my phone off for hours. I've reached my breaking point and I've had enough. I regret it. Now, looking back, I know it was dramatic. I just don't know where to go from here. I don't really want to go back because I know I won't have been missed.",,False,False,parenting

We both want another baby. I want her to start working. My income alone is not enough. The bills are paid. And we barely scrape by. Mine and her credit is below average. We are surviving. Not living. But she is totally against daycare. Totally against someone else watching her. Even her own family member babysitting. She wants to stay home with our child until she can start preschool. And also wants another baby within a year or 2. Also wants to stay home until our next baby can start preschool. But she doesnt want a preschool thats public funded she wants a nice one. Thats not possible on my income so i would have to work until our children are in kindergarten and 4th grade. Nothing i reccomend is good enough for her whenever i bring it up she gets defensive and shuts down. Looking for a job stresses her out. I bought an online course and laptop for her to get her license to sell insurance because she seemed to gravitate towards that career path. She has given up on that. I want more. Financially we are at a brick wall. We cannot get approved for a house or a car if we wanted given our credit situation. I dont know how to get through to her on this.

552,School refuses to let my trans kid share a room with his friends on a class trip,"Throwaway account, sorry if this is against the rules. I have an 11 year old son who was born a girl, but socially lives as a boy. No permanent medical stuff has been done, but he has short hair, wears boys' clothes and has insisted on being called a male name ever since he was in pre-school. He started middle school (6th grade) a couple of weeks ago and though his friends know he's trans, they accept him as a boy no questions asked. His teacher recently announced that they will be going on a class trip later this school year. They'll spend 4 nights away from home and will be put into gender-segregated rooms with 4-6 kids each. Here's where the issue comes in. The teacher is adamant that my son has to share a room with a group of girls because he's biologically female. He got extremely upset when she told him that, because not only does he hate the fact that his teacher sees him as a girl on some level, but he's also sad and upset that he won't get to share a room with his friends, whom he has known since pre-school and who would have zero issues with him sharing a room with them. He said the teacher is trying to ruin the trip for him for no reason, that his friends will have all of their fun without him, and that the entire point of a trip like that is to stay up all night and have fun with his friends. He's completely devastated and has been acting out in that teacher's class ever since. I already tried calling the teacher, but she said that it ""doesn't matter how he dresses, he's still technically a girl"" and that the other parents would make a fuss about it if their kids were forced to share a room with a child of the opposite sex (I know the parents, they wouldn't, my son has literally had sleepovers at their houses), and that it's probably not even legally possible (we are in rural California if that matters). I have no idea what to do. My son is extremely upset and doesn't get why everyone always treats him like he did something wrong when he just wants to share a room with his friends like any other kid. He also doesn't like the idea of just not going on the trip at all (which would be an option, and I brought it up when we talked about the situation). What do we do in this situation? I can't see any situation in which my son sleeps in the girls' room (and to be honest, the girls would probably be somewhat uncomfortable with it), but I have no idea if he's even legally allowed to share a room with the boys or how to convince the school on this issue. God damn, this is a new school and I already know the next 3 years are going to be an uphill battle. What do we do? (If you comment, please don't say anything along the lines of it being child abuse that we let him transition socially. I've heard that a million times. You have no idea how much my son would suffer if we forced him to be a girl, and we always give him the option to change his mind).",,False,False,parenting

So when my toddler asked for a story, I came across it so I went ahead and read it to him. I was quite surprised that the actual story was actually so full of scenes of bullying, it was so depressing. Even the duckling himself seems to have had PTSD from all the bullying.  I don't know if it's because I have depression and anxiety myself thats why it seems outrageous to me for something like this to be included in stories for kids.

554,"Parent of an Autistic Child, here to say Thank You for raising kids to embrace differences",My almost 4yo limited verbally child was invited to a birthday party for his 3rd cousin around the same age.  Essentially my ASD son was surrounded by NT kids right around his same age and a few of their older siblings.  Outside of other cousins he didnt know any of them. My son isn't great at interacting with other kids but it never slows him down from having a great time.  He's the type of kid that is ALWAYS smiling (or melting down...) but he plays a bit differently and can take a bit longer to get something done. This party had a few bouncy houses and a few bouncy slides.  My son LOVES jumping and slides (very sensory seeking).  After getting over the initial anxiety of a new situation he was off to have fun. The biggest attraction was a tall bouncy slide you had to scale a big ladder/incline to slide down.  It was really tough for my little guy.  He was taking 2 - 3x as long as the other kids. Instead of climbing over him or getting impatient his older cousin (7) and another older girl (6?) took charge and made a barrier behind him so he could walk up while blocking others from trying to push past him.  Eventually all of the other kids started supporting him too - even cheering him on at times. My son climbed up that slide and slid down about 10 times (until he had to be pulled up the slide he was so tired). Just a post to thank you for those raising kids that help those that are differently abled instead of pushing them to the side.

556,Concern for wife‚Äôs mental state - wakes up thinking she is holding newborn but isn‚Äôt,"My (32M) wife (30F) gave birth 2 weeks ago to our firstborn daughter. We spent a full week in the hospital as daughter had bad jaundice and had to go under the lights. Neither of us got much sleep in the first week as I would be up for all feeds with her and helping to express and finger feed. Since being home her milk has come in but there is still supply issues at night. This has led to some cluster feeds between 10pm and 4am. My main concern is that a few times my wife has woke up when bubs is crying and clearly isn‚Äôt fully with it. The other night she woke up went to the bathroom and then said ‚Äúshould I try the other boob‚Äù, thinking she had just been breastfeeding but bubs had been asleep for a few hours. Last night she woke up and was holding the blanket from our bed asking me to help her find the baby‚Äôs head.. but bubs was crying in the cot next to our bed. When I looked at her concerned and pointed this out she started crying. I then told her to get some sleep and took bubs downstairs for a formula feed. I plan to do a few more formula feeds to help her get more sleep going forward. To date I try to help with expressed bottle feeds but they are mostly as a top up if bubs won‚Äôt rest. I guess I just wanted to hear if anyone else had similar experiences or advice? I am about to go back to work tomorrow and am a little concerned that I won‚Äôt be around next time this happens. Should we have her see someone or does she just need a decent rest? EDIT: Thanks for all the replies, she managed to pump a fair bit by missing this morning‚Äôs feed that I replaced with formula so I am trying to give her a chance to skip a feed at night now. We have also flagged with her ob-gyn so hopefully he gives her a call in the next few days to discuss.

561,"My humble take on Parenting, as a non-biological mom.","I (f29) met my girlfriend (f34) when her daughter G was 5. Once things got serious and we fell in love, I often struggled with feeling excluded from the beautiful bond that they shared, the history they lovingly recalled and the mom-and-daughter thing that I wasn't part of. It felt like I was a third wheel, and I was so anxious that if this was to become my forever family, I might never feel like I'm ""in"" it, which was devastating to me as I had an incredibly close family growing up and wanted it to feel the same between me and my kids. Plus a little jealousy at being firmly in second place for my girlfriend's attention when a choice had to be made. Fair, but also a shock to the system after a childfree dating history! My relationship with little G started slowly, always on her shy terms, but we quickly realised that we like a lot of the same stuff. I have many hobbies, and I'm pretty sure no child on earth can resist the urge to check out a sewing machine. Plus, she was interesting to me, I'd not really been around kids before so I enjoyed this new first-hand look into the ludicrous things they do and say. We became good friends. Still, I felt like something was missing, I didn't WANT to be just the fun one. The cool grownup. Always feeling awkward and powerless when gently telling her off or showing careful affection. It didn't feel like parenting and I still wasn't sure how to let go of the fact that this didn't match the matriarchal role I'd always pictured myself having in my home. It left me feeling quietly and chronically disappointed. I eventually had to make a choice: figure it out, or call it off. We were talking about having more kids, and I ESPECIALLY did not want to find a baby-shaped wedge driven through mine and G's fragile relationship. Imagine the inequality once I fell in love with her sibling, known since birth, and had a new role as bona fide parent to this other kid but not to her. I didn't want that dynamic anywhere near my home, I just wanted it to be ""normal"" but I didn't know what to do to get myself there. So I started observing my girlfriend with new eyes, Attenborough-style. What was she actually DOING to be a parent? Lots of it was out of my reach - I couldn't just decide that I'd be the one to comfort G after her next nightmare, or tell her to go have a bath - so what else is Parenting? I watched what my girlfriend packed for school lunch, and then tried my hand at it every now and again. One time I didn't give her enough food, that was awful. Mostly I gave way too much. But it got me invested in hearing whether she ate it, and I started paying attention to what she liked and disliked. One day I did her laundry. Folded her tiny undies and repacked her messy drawers neatly. My girlfriend is not the folding type, so this new organisation went over well with both of them. It also brought out a VERY orderly side to this kid (to this day) which I know is 100% from me. And Marie Kondo. One by one, I picked up menial jobs involved in Raising Children, and every single one increased my feelings of responsibility for her. I became attentive, I now had a hand in the success of our household. Seeing the fruits of my labour was rewarding and encouraging - I helped her with her extra handwriting practice and she improved greatly. I was able to feel proud of her for the first time. The harder I worked at it, the more affectionate this little girl became - it was her way of reciprocating the care and nurturing she felt consistently from me. She responded so well that it made me double down. I taught her how to make french toast, I learned all her doll's names, I took her grocery shopping and became the preferred hair-brusher. I made the conscious decision to parent, and our relationship blossomed as a result. She respected me as a parental figure because I was holding up my end of the deal, so suddenly I felt confident to tell her when she'd had enough screen time, or that it was time to tidy up. My wonderful girlfriend allowed me to step into this space and practice parenting, and I learned so much from her. As a previously single mum she is still pleasantly surprised at how nice it is to share the load with someone else, we are a team and it's brought us so much closer. We passionately celebrate every milestone she crushes, we play the Easter Bunny and Santa together, and every morning we wait for her to run in and insistently shove her little body between us for a morning cuddle. It's been a win-win-win. With her little brother due in a couple months, I have NO idea how our family dynamic is about to change. She'll be 8 soon. It's scary, but I'm not scared of the same things I used to be because now she feels like mine.",,False,False,parenting

Her response was legitimate concern that I would even consider it, and she can't believe I would ever send him over to just knock. That I should at the least go with him. They've played a number of times before. They're six houses down from us. It's a quiet, safe street, and there is plenty for them to do outside. We know the parents and have spent time with them on numerous occasions. And it's not a covid thing. It's a ""that's not something people do"" thing. That's how I grew up. I just told my mom I was going over to so-and-so's house, and we'd play. I did that at a very early age. Am I in the wrong?",,False,False,parenting
564,My newborn (2 weeks old) refuses to breast feed and it is breaking my wife.,"Everyone told my wife and continues to tell her ""breast feeding is such an amazing experience, you're going to bond so much with your child."" Not a single person has said ""you don't HAVE to breast feed them, not everyone can."" Everytime we offer our baby the boob, he screams bloody murder and refuses to latch. The only advise she has gotten was from her sister, which was ""just don't feed him until he takes it from the boob, he'll give up screaming eventually."" She can't handle making her own baby cry like that. She feels like a bad mother and like she is emotionally scarring her baby and like every time she tries again, she is reinforcing a negative experience. So everytime she has to feed him, she feeds and then pumps, feeds and then pumps. Feeding him can take anywhere from .5 to 1 hour, and then pumping takes another .5 hours, so basically half her day is used up trying to feed our baby in a process that would be much less taxing on her if he would just take the damn boob. We've tried getting the flow started before offering it to him, putting formula on it, using nipple gaurds, nipple extensions, we're out of ideas and emotional energy at this point. Rant over. Thanks for listening. Can you tell this is our first baby? Edit 1: We have seen multiple lactation consultants multiple times. He is not tounge tied.

565,Teen wants to go to a party- HELP!,"My 14 (almost 15) year old daughter is a freshman in high school this year. She has always been very mature for her age and we have always had very open communication. We talk on a daily basis about her life, the lives of the kids around her and the things they do drugs, sex (makes me want to scream, but I let her talk about them as it seems like she frowns on their activities). She has always been comfortable coming to me with the most sensitive of subjects. Last night, she said she was invited to a party and wanted to go. The girls she knows are on her volleyball team but are a little older than her - they are sophomores. Without me asking a thing, she spouted off details. She said the parents will be there and flay out told me there will be alcohol at the party. She said boys are staying the night so I want you to pick me up. I stared off into space for a moment trying to let this all process. I have always told her that I know she is going to do things I don't approve of but please just always call me to get you - no questions asked. I have considered ground rules. No drinking, no drugs, stay with a buddy the entire night, open your own drinks, do not leave with anyone, etc. I would really appreciate any advice. I am so grateful for all of the responses! I guess my biggest concern is her never letting me in on anything else and doing it anyway. She has told me how her friends are jealous and tell her how lucky she is because she doesn't have to lie and sneak like they do. I'm sure she still does occasionally, but she really does tell me a lot - even things that make make want want claw my own eyes out. She even had me set up a Life 360 so I always know where she is! Her friends wanted to sneak out one night to walk a mile up the road from her friend's house. She texted me immediately asked me to download it but didn't say why. I did and the next day she told me they wanted to sneak out but she wasn't comfortable so she said I was watching her location on life 360 and showed them her app. I was so impressed... I don't want all of that to go down the drain and have to worry about where she is or who she is with and if she is safe. I am so thankful that she shares everything and I do not think she has any bad intentions. She's a real smart kid and she's really smart about weird people and being aware of her surroundings. To Catch a Predator is one of her favorite shows she watches on YouTube and she is always telling me how her friends need to be more careful on social media and such. I just feel like she has a lot of common sense and she could have just gone and said she was going with a friend for the night after the dance and I would have never known. I do not want this to be the beginning of that because that's exactly what I did and my mother would not have known where to start searching for my body! Update: The party is this coming Saturday and I have agreed to let her go with conditions: She received a long lecture on alcohol (and drugs) as well as reminders of how it effects your judgment and might impact her participation in sports. She was also reminded that being cool is being confident in yourself and you do not need to do anything to prove your worth to anyone. We discussed the horror stories I read about high school/college kids and the accidental deaths from alcohol poisoning. She is not to leave the house until I am in the driveway to pick her up.",,False,False,parenting
566,8 week old banshee - please tell me again it gets better,"I know it gets better, I know it's a phase. Just... Please say it again. She's 8 weeks now. Even the midwife, soon after birth, still in the delivery room, called her spirited. If she's hungry - she cries. Tired - cries. Bored - cries. Held in a wrong position - cries. Anything else she's unhappy with - cries. And with crying, I'm not taking about gentle ""I'm not ok with this"" whine-cry-protest. I'm talking about 100% full on loud as hell crying. She's not colicky, she just knows what she doesnt like - there's always a reason for her crying. And if her needs are not met immediately, within 10 seconds, the crying escalates to 200% full on war-wailing. Fists clenched, muscles tense, body arched, wrath of a thousand suns type of wail. And she will not stop. If we're out on a walk, and she's in her pram, and gets a wet diaper, or generally doesn't want to be in the pram, she'll wail for 30 minutes easy, basically until we get home and fix the issue. Same with every single issue. They say crying peaks around this time, but it's been like this since day one. No peaks to be had with her intensity already through the roof, apparently. The other mothers in a local group have such easy babies compared to her. I've come to realize that the saying ""well, at least she won't be a door mat later in life!"" is nothing but a hollow attempt of desperate, sleep deprived parents to create some kind of silver lining in all of this. At least she gives us smiles daily now, they help keep us afloat in the daily cacophony of our life. I know she's young. I know (or at least pray to all deities) that it will pass. Just, please reiterate it to me, tell me of your high demand babies who turned out to be wonderful toddlers who don't scream every time something is slightly amiss. Sincerely, a mother who's starting to feel like a deaf zombie. Edit: thank you all for the wonderful and reassuring stories!

Both of my kids are healthy weights. I always try to serve some sort of vegetable or fruit with every meal. I am a single mom so I try to put something decent together knowing what they like. Last night night, I cooked frozen fried chicken and green beans. Something they both love. But my daughter only ate a small amount of green beans. She had a meltdown when I told her to take some chicken and more food, and she said she will get fat if she eats too much and the chicken is bad for her because it is fried. I asked her who would tell her that and she said that it was said at the assembly. Idk who told her, but it's not something she would come up with on her own and it's not something you should tell kids, that they will be fat by eating something. This morning for breakfast, I microwaved french toast sticks and gave them each half a banana. My daughter only ate the banana so I gave her another half. I'm assuming they told her bread was bad for you too. I honestly don't know what to do. Would it be overreacting to talk to the school?

I shaved for the first time in 4 month, put on a face mask and did my nails, things I did not do since her birth six months ago. It felt good. She is happily brabbling and laughing at the TV and I just cant feel good because the mom guilt of using the TV for selfish reasons drives me crazy. I feel horrible and lazy. Please tell me I am not alone in this... Edit: So now Im not only getting downvoted for stating studies, but also hate messages?

573,Jumped into pool during daughters swim class,"Today at my daughter‚Äôs swim class, we ran into someone we haven‚Äôt seen for a while. Her daughter and my daughter were signed up for the same class and we sat on one of the benches by the pool as we chatted and caught up with each other. I was going back and forth between watching my daughter (4 years old) and looking at our friend/acquaintance. During one of those times, I turned back to my daughter and saw that she was struggling to get her head above water‚Äîface fully submerged and doggy paddle combination. It looked to me like she was struggling and i wasn‚Äôt sure how long this was going on for. I walked up to the side of the pool and asked ‚Äúhey ___, are you ok?‚Äù but she didn‚Äôt respond and kept doing the same thing. From the time I first saw her struggle to asking if she was ok, it was maybe 10 seconds. I got nervous and tried to reach for her. She was close to the pool edge but not close enough for me to reach. In my moment of panic, I just jumped into the water to pull her up. She seemed fine, not panicky or anything. I was drenched from upper torso down, including shoes. The thing is, where my daughter was ‚Äústruggling‚Äù, there‚Äôs a platform under them. All the students stand there and wait while the instructor takes turns with the students. If she just stood up, she would‚Äôve been fine. Later on I asked her what she was doing and she said she tried to swim but couldn‚Äôt reach the bars. (The bars are attached to the platform.) I‚Äôm pretty embarrassed that I likely over-reacted, and in front of an acquaintance nonetheless. She was really nice about it and didn‚Äôt say anything other than ask if I‚Äôm ok and offer a towel, but omg I‚Äôm feeling super silly right now. Probably should‚Äôve tried to yell out to her to stand up first before going on a rescue mission but mom panic really kicked in. Several people around us asked if I was ok which made me realize how bad this must‚Äôve looked lol. We will see her every week since our girls are in the same class and on top of that we have a lot of common acquaintances. I just wanna dig a hole and hide üôà Edit to add: thank you everyone for your stories and support! I did not expect to get so many responses. I definitely felt self conscious after the fact because the other mom used to teach swim lessons in that very pool in her teens. Now she‚Äôs a medical professional and and the sweetest person ever! I don‚Äôt think she would judge but likely would‚Äôve handled the situation better given her swim and medical background. And that makes me feel embarrassed for just acting on impulse. (When we both looked back at the pool and saw my daughter, she said ‚Äúuh oh‚Äù, but thats probably more of a playful uh oh than a serious uh oh? I probably should‚Äôve stayed calm and turned around to ask her what to do when my daughter didn‚Äôt respond to me ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but those stories of kids drowning in 30 seconds really got to me.)

588,Christmas and Nosey kids,"About 4 years ago, I decided to change how I wrap our family‚Äôs Christmas presents. I was getting so tired of my oldest feeling package shapes and shaking them, trying to figure out what was inside. Additionally, I had a 2 year old that would emulate the older siblings behavior, and did NOT want to fight that battle everyday. So, I quietly purchased wrapping paper rolls matching the number of people in our family, and coordinated one roll to each individual‚Äôs gifts. No name tags. My oldest thought this was a mistake; as soon as the first presents were placed under the tree, she began to snoop and asked how she would know which one was hers. I explained that each person had a specific wrapping paper assigned to them, and which wrapping paper it was would be revealed to them on Christmas morning, with a piece of the coordinating wrapping paper in the toe of their stocking. (We always empty stockings first on Xmas morning) Y‚Äôall, I can‚Äôt even BEGIN to tell you how well this worked! My oldest kept her hands off the presents because she didn‚Äôt want to mess up what could end up being someone else‚Äôs gift. Furthermore, she helped teach her 2 year old sibling to keep her hands off the gifts as well, since she didn‚Äôt want the toddler touching gifts that belonged to her in the end. It worked so well that this will be our 4th year of this new tradition. They speculate endlessly on which person each wrapping paper is assigned, but they are only using their eyes and NOT their hands!

Most of the stuff I get her are from target, old navy , and children‚Äôs place,  . I explained that she is 5 and outgrows things quickly as well as gets them dirty at school. He went on to tell me that she will get made fun of for having clothes from these stores and that I should be spending more money on her clothing.

591,How do you accept when your kids are terrible?,"I‚Äôm sobbing as I write this. I pride myself on being a good mom. I make sure my kids have hot and healthy breakfasts. I cook healthy dinners and snacks. We have family meals. We do family activities like game nights and bike rides. I have Mommy and Me journals for both of my kids (8F and 6m). I make sure I do one on one time with each of them. I take them to the library once a week. I read bedtime stories and sing songs every night. I make sure they go to a nice school and have help with their homework. And yet‚Ä¶ My kids are NIGHTMARES. I try to show them how to be nice and respectful. They are not spoiled. They have chores and we run a structured household. We discipline consistently. But they are rude and mean to each other and the others around them. They lie to us. They refuse to follow any rules. The worst part of this is that my husband, their stepdad, has worked so damn hard to build relationships with them and they are so rude in return. He is a lovely family man and they don‚Äôt even come close to appreciating him. I‚Äôm not going to waste 1000 words on explaining but trust that it‚Äôs so bad that they made him cry last week. I‚Äôm now finding that they go back to their dads house (we have 50/50 custody) and talking about how mean we are and specifically how horrible my husband is. We have rules but I would definitely say we‚Äôre not mean. Their dad is very much the Disney dad though. He only does fun stuff and spoils them rotten. My husband and I feel gutted.

594,Ridiculous supervised visitation and covid rules with a infant that doesn't know you.,"My son turns one at the end of the month. His mother has withheld visitation since March. I filed for paternity a month after he was born in September when it became clear she was going to withhold. Anyway my ex is extremely high conflict, I'm not going to throw terms around, but she's very difficult to say the least. I have joint legal, I've spent 20k so far, and a bullshit civil order she filed two weeks before our first custody hearing. If I need to give details on why it's bullshit I can. But anyway I haven't seen him in months, and at my last hearing the judge said because I have no time with baby which wasn't by my choice that be wants me to do supervised visits at a family center. I really have no reason to be supervised because I'm not a convicted felon like my ex is, but judge said heir on the side of caution and he wants to read the reports from the family center on how I interact with my son. I've done two different parenting classes, completed one, but didn't finish the other. And I signed up for these on my own. I did my orientation the other day and because of covid there's are all these rules that I feel will make trying to bond with my son even harder. I have to wear a mask, and I can't even bring food or snacks or even damn toys. If he cries for more than ten minutes, they cut the visitation. I feel like I'm just being setup for failure here. My ex has effectively killed my bond with my son, I don't feel the same as I did months ago. I don't cry for him anymore. I guess mostly because I came to terms with things that are out of my control and more accepting of this situation. I don't even know if I want to take these visitations that I'm going to be setup for failure from the start, because I feel like I'm going to get triggered and fall back into this rabbit hole, only to have him yanked from me all over again. These past few months have been difficult to say the least. I pay cs and medical. We have a trial scheduled in December. Judge said he hopes we figure it out by then.

596,Is it bad to lie about what is in a dish in order to get a kid to eat it?,"My stepson is a notoriously picky eater.  I do most of the cooking, and I struggle to find things that this kid will eat.  He‚Äôs 9 and goes through phases of being SUPER into a certain few foods.  Over the last few months, it‚Äôs been crescent rolls and mac and cheese.  Obviously I‚Äôm not making that every night.  The problem is that he is fine with eating next to nothing if it‚Äôs not something he enjoys.  For example, I made spaghetti the other night.  My spaghetti is, according to most, very good.  But he picked at it, ate a handful of bites, and then wanted to be done.  I am not going to sit there and force him to stuff himself with food that he doesn‚Äôt like, but I do let him know that there is no snacking after dinner unless he eats an acceptable amount for dinner. The biggest problem is that he THINKS that he doesn‚Äôt like certain foods, but if he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs eating, he loves them.  An example of this is last night.  He swears up and down that he won‚Äôt touch gravy.  It‚Äôs appalling to him.  But I made some homemade breakfast pot pies with eggs, gravy, and sausage and he gobbled it up, stating that he would eat it tomorrow if he could.  Another example is fish.  He won‚Äôt eat fish, but I made a creamy salmon pasta that he loved, assuming it was chicken. Well, a tactic that I have found (and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs ethical or not) is to be vague when I‚Äôm telling him the ingredients.  For the pasta, I just called it creamy pasta.  For the pot pies, he asked what the ‚Äúsauce‚Äù (gravy) was, and I told him that it was ‚Äúbreakfast sauce‚Äù.  His dislike of most foods is almost entirely mental, and no amount of explaining or urging to try something new works.  I just have to‚Ä¶ lie. I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about this.

597,Ended a long Cold War with kid‚Äôs step mom by getting her a Mother‚Äôs Day gift.,"TLDR: Peace offering sent on visit weekend was met with an opportunity to bury the hatchet and received a sweet gift and sweet moment in return. It‚Äôs been a VERY rocky relationship from the beginning with my ex and his partner. I really never expected them to last, let alone even stay sober, or out of jail. She has a child that lives with her parents and I have been really mean saying she shouldn‚Äôt be around mine if she can‚Äôt have hers. I didn‚Äôt want my kids to visit, at all, and they didn‚Äôt have any respect for my time, opinions, or rules/routines. Unfortunately, a lot has been said and done on both sides that is embarrassing and ugly. They have been very adamant that they want to be involved and have as much time as possible with them. It‚Äôs been almost 4 years now. They‚Äôve stayed sober, employed and consistent. Tensions have calmed, and communication has developed enough for the ability to adjust schedules and pick-ups, but is not friendly or chatty-just the bare minimum to get the job done. In fact, I‚Äôve had her blocked for 2 years because I didn‚Äôt want to argue. Also, we live two hours apart, so meeting up is a huge pain in the butt for all of us. Due to swapping visits for birthday parties and other things, I set up for a visit two weekends in a row to make up for it as a thank you for allowing it and not making it into an argument. That included this weekend, not realizing it was Mother‚Äôs Day. My husband was upset and wanted me to switch it, but I felt that wouldn‚Äôt be fair, and also decided that the kids needed to send a Mother‚Äôs Day gift for her. Side note-I had a HORRIBLE narcissistic step mother that I still have lasting trauma from. It means so much to me that my kids are not experiencing the same. They love her, and she loves them. It‚Äôs hard to share and get over hurt feelings and egos from the past, but she honestly deserves my acknowledgment and appreciation for not being the wicked step mother. I know they‚Äôre safe there. I sent a gift wrapped up really cute over with the kids Friday night. She text from my ex‚Äôs phone telling me how much it meant to her and how much she really liked it. I took the opportunity to share my appreciation for her and about my step mother, and apologized for things I‚Äôve said in the past. Today when we picked up the kids I was given a gift that I absolutely love also. I didn‚Äôt expect anything at all and already knew nothing was coming from my own kids this year (busy 2 week, and then leaving town to visit). I ran to catch her car to go tell her thank you before she left. I was surprised at how emotional it made me and when I got to her found tears in both our eyes and we hugged and thanked each other and wished one another a happy Mother‚Äôs Day. It felt good and i had a long drive home to write this and share. I just unblocked her number also, hahah. I hope this continues, but if not at least we have 2022 to remember I truly want to have a better relationship and example for the kids and my own sanity.

602,"Is ""no trampolines ever"" a reasonable rule or am I projecting my trauma on my kids?","I would like my two kids to never set foot on a trampoline, preferably forever, or at least until I no longer am making their rules, and I want an outside perspective on if this is a reasonable rule or is too informed by my own trauma. Long story short, in college, my little brother got a spinal cord injury at a trampoline park and was paralyzed from the neck down. Thanks to immediate surgery and luck of how the injury occurred, he eventually regained most function after 6 months in a rehab hospital and now doesn't appear affected at all, although he still has some invisible effects. Obviously, this was super traumatic and life-changing, definitely for him, but for me and the rest of our family too. It's horrible and heartbreaking to see your baby brother paralyzed and to not know if he'd ever walk again. Given that history, and the stats I've seen around trampoline injuries, I don't want my kids on trampolines ever. We will definitely never own one, and I'd like to say no to any birthday parties at trampoline parks too. At a birthday party today at a kids gym, my 4 year old briefly bounced on a very small one, and it made me silently panic, even though I know he couldn't have really gotten hurt on that one.

605,I've become a worse parent over the last 2 years. Tonight my son opened my eyes.,"Lockdown has been hard on everyone and as a family we are no exception. When my first son was born we had boundaries both for him and us and we worked hard as parents to bring him up in a wonderful environment. My second son was born and we had some medical trouble but it all settled down. Life got busy and we feel we failed him early on. Not enough book reading to him, to much TV sometimes (something that we would never have dreamed of giving my oldest) we havs worked hard to rectify that. Our daughter was born in January of last year and obviously early in the year it became apparent that it was not going to be a normal year. We were both lucky to be able to work from home. Our 2 youngest go to daycare and our oldest did a lockdown year in his first year of school and now is doing the same in his second. We get that naturally your time is divided with the more children you have. But covid has sapped our energy. We work, do schooling and then have to muster up the energy to be parents of 3 at the end of the day. We got lazy, we get cranky and we have taken shortcuts. To much takeaway, to much TV, to much escaping on our own computers to get some time alone. We have also gotten shorter with the kids. We just dont posses the patience we once had. Today it was fathers day. My oldest spent the week making things for me. Cards, why I love my dad letters. Making me love harts in Lego. We finish dinner, I'm on the couch watching TV while he is playing with his siblings in a play tent in the lounge. I find out he has scraped off some chocolate topping from the cake due after dinner. Guess what, I did the same last week. But I'd forgotten that, I'm tired, I'm cranky. I ban him from cake untill tomorrow. Harsher consequences teach the better lessons right? I hear a sniffle. I go and tell my son that he did the wrong thing and that it's not the end of the world as there is some cake tomorrow. He looks sad so I get in the tent with him and ask him to talk to me. ""I did all this stuff for you this week dad to show you how much I love you and this is how you show me how much you love me"" it's dead apparent that he's not faking this to get cake. That moment and line snapped me back into reality. He worked hard all week for me and I completely ruin his day, the day he has been exited about for a week. I heartfelt apologise, something I'm not used to doing and give him some cake. That night I am tucking him in as he is sad that fathers day was a bad one becuase he got told off. I was always proud of my parenting. Over the last few years I've become emotionally vacant and have spent hours getting professional help. No excuses intended but it links back to the early passing of my dad. A hero of mine. I've become everything I set out to never be and this has been exaggerated by lockdowns and covid.

606,Can't bring myself to show my daughter to my mother,"I had a pretty bad childhood that I'm scared to think about to this day. No violence, just permanent conflict, bad blood, emotional abuse. As far as I remember, my mother gave us the silent treatment for about 50 % of our childhood for any little thing - this made me constantly feel guilty, invisible, not good enough. Everything I did was insufficient for her, I stopped letting her know anything about my privacy because I knew she would hurt me if she had any info about me that made me vulnerable. She used to tell us we were parasites and she was looking forward to the day we left the house... etc. etc., hopefully you get the picture. I have spent the last 10 to 15 years running away from her, moved far from her place, reduced contact. The more I did this, the more I healed and only recently I felt like I became a fully functioning person instead of the wreck I used to be at home (always scared, extremely socially anxious, deeply depressed, feeling unworthy). A few months ago, I had my own daughter and I immediately knew that I wanted her to have nothing to do with the way things were in my childhood.

We‚Äôve had a lot happen this past year, my dad dying, his aunt (whom he was extremely close with) dying, moving to a different town and his dad getting out of prison after a few years. He started a new school this year since we moved to a new town and he knew absolutely no one. He‚Äôs been emotionally shut down from all of these events and is in counseling multiple times a week for it. He has had a very hard time making friends here and this year he has came home from school defeated at trying to fit in no matter what he does. He‚Äôs in sports, I‚Äôve had him in some grieving for kids groups, and he is in a lunch group at his school to try and make friends and he just always seems to be the odd one out because of how quiet he is. He‚Äôs also been bullied for it and I‚Äôve been working with the school over it. He came home on Wednesday super excited for the first time asking if I would buy him a yearbook because they are doing signings on Friday (today) and he really wanted join in. Of course I get excited with him and send him money the next day to purchase one. Well, today he comes home and goes straight to his room. I open his door and excitedly ask him to see his yearbook and want him to show me all of the signatures he got from kids at school.

615,People who say it doesn‚Äôt get easier it gets different are lying.,"When my son was a baby, people would tell me it wouldn‚Äôt get easier, it would get different.

Potty training is hell (and didnt really work for 2 years for us.). Ya it gets different. And a whole lot better. My son who was a disaster in his early years is now the sweetest, easiest 4 year old. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time we had a serious issue. Ya he sometimes has too much energy and I get tired. But for the most part, every second with him is a joy, and I never want it to end. So if you have young kids and you‚Äôre wondering when it will get better, I‚Äôd say every kid is different, but it does get much much better. Don‚Äôt even get me started the people who told me the newborn phase was the easy phase. When your baby is up every 45 min, it doesn‚Äôt feel so easy, and I was sure I was a horrible mom if I couldn‚Äôt even handle the newborn phase. It gets better!!!!!!!",,False,False,parenting

I asked why and they reluctantly told me they were sad because they would normally go with her to shop for gifts for me, and instead would only be able to make me handmade gifts.  Of course I told them those were the best gifts, that I didn‚Äôt need anything, but they were not cheered.  My wife and I concocted a plan, where I bought myself gifts (some PJ pants and a new electric razor), which she then discreetly told the kids had been purchased on her behalf by a ‚Äúwork friend‚Äù and let them sort out which one they would give to me.  They just reported to me that the problem we‚Äôd discussed the other day had been mysteriously solved, and their faces could barely contain their grins.

This kid made a list off all the good deeds he did and gave Santa his kindergarten report card for his Barbie taking Dream house. Santa doesn't give the big presents in our family, just smaller toys sometimes related to the big presents. We he saw Santa gave him a Barbie he knew the big gift was his Dreamhouse. But mom and mother forgot to pick up batteries. My nephew was to young to understand why stores are closed on Christmas and why mom and mother can't magically produced. I still remember him in full tears explaining to me that Barbie Dreamhouse isn't a dream if it doesn't magically talk. Walmart opened at 6am the following morning and his mom was the first customer in the store. And then her and her wife couldn't find the screwdriver when she got home.

619,If a grandmother expects to celebrated on Mother‚Äôs Day she should act like a mother,"You can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it. A few posts on this topic lately and a common opinion seems to be ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt stop being a mum just because you have grandchildren‚Äù. As a general notion, I can agree. However, I‚Äôve also seen a loooot of posts in support of the new cool grandparents who don‚Äôt have time to see their grandchildren as they‚Äôre busy travelling the world or growing their own hobbies. Many of who had a lot of help from their parents growing up. And that‚Äôs where something starts to not add up. I am NOT saying that it should be expected of grandparents to babysit all the time; they‚Äôre not the parents. However, if ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt stop being a parent just because you have grandchildren‚Äù is true when it comes to celabrating a holiday, then I think it‚Äôs certainly true in terms of what can be expected of a ‚Äúparent‚Äù to an adult. Personally I think you never stop being a parent and I would NEVER leave my child to fend for their own entirely just because they turn 18. Even if they stand on their own feet I will always be there for support and aid when necessary. Although not legally necessary I think this can be expected of a (good) parent to adult children. When I struggled as a new parent a year ago when LO was newly born my mum and dad were nowhere to be seen. Because of the pandemic I accepted this but had hoped to get some guidance and advise over the phone from an experienced mother. I cried and bled from my nipples every feed and tried to get help from the hospital but didn‚Äôt get any. When I finally cracked at called my mum for support while struggling with the tears to talk she as quickly as possible found an excuse to end the call. In the coming weeks she sent pics of what she was up to without asking about how my the baby and I were. As soon as the restrictions lifted a bit my parents started to travel the entire country. In the months after my daughter was born I‚Äôve never seen them travel so much. No travel ever ended with the destination of their granddaughter. I‚Äôve been absolutely crushed about how little my mum seems to care about her new grandchild. Honesty I don‚Äôt care so much about Mother‚Äôs Day and it‚Äôs surprising that I would make a post about it really. But I guess it‚Äôs more about the principle. TLDR; Yes the notion of ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt stop being a mum just because you get grandchildren‚Äù is true but a grandmother can‚Äôt cherry pick when it‚Äôs true.

I actually found that all the mothers over 50 in my life were the ones telling me I couldn't have a life, and I shouldn't be asking my husband for help with the baby. Anyway. I gave hubs the cold should last night. Didn't make him breakfast this morning. I took my wedding bands off to do the dishes and forgot to put them back on. I then took my dogs and the baby for a long walk without telling him. I didn't take my phone. I come home and he is PANICKING. He though I had left him. My god, he took his daughter and besides the occasional hand off for boobie snacks. He took care of her from about 2pm - 9. At 9, we all sat on the porch and watched the thunderstorm for a few minutes. Then we put her to bed together. I didn't even do it on purpose... but today I got almost the whole day to cook (which I enjoy doing) finish baby's new summer dress and just breath. Today was my husband's day off. Note, we all have COVID at the moment. He says he is too sick to hold her. Uhm, I have it too...so he plays video games from 2pm- 12am. In that time I made breakfast and lunch, Tidied the nursery, did the dishes because we had no clean cutlery. Plus entertained and fed the baby. I asked him to please watch her so I could just sit for an hour. He says he just took some cold medication and it should kick in in about an hour..he can take her then. I just put her to bed when he came up to tuck himself into bed. A few days ago before COVID I asked him for a break. He thought about it and said...""ok, I can give you 30 minutes"" I didn't even get my full 30 minutes because she did a huge spit up on herself and he apparently needed my help to change her. I got 17 minutes. And 5 of that was using the bathroom. So my question is, should I push the issue of him taking more responsibility for his baby? As a mother who is on maternity leave, am I allowed to ask for an hour for just me? Is it fair to ask my husband to watch her for an hour a day even though he works? By the way, his version of watching her is plopping her in her bouncer and watching his gamer YouTube videos. I asked him not to sit her so close to the computer and he said ""fine, you take her then"" I shit you not, she just woke up and he picked her up from her crib and handed her to me. Because ""he is drowsy from the cold medication.""",,False,False,parenting

628,Grandparents blatantly said that they don't want to help with the baby,"So I'm about 5 months pregnant with my first child and it's been pretty rough. The pregnancy was very unexpected, but happy surprise. My husband and I have been married for two years, we're both in our late 20s, and both work full time. Right now I earn a lot more than my husband and basically support us both as well as being in college full time for my doctorate. I've always told my mother that I really didn't think that my husband and I could afford to have a child,  let alone have the time to raise one, at this stage in our lives. It would just be way too difficult on us. My mother INSISTED on us having kids and (both my parents are retired) stated that she would drop everything to help care for our child and we wouldn't have to worry about childcare. My father was also constantly asking when we would finally have a grandchild. Both my parents are VERY financially well off due to good investing and good luck on my father's part and my mother has never worked a day in her life. Wellllll, unfortunately our birth control method failed and I'm pregnant. We're happy about having a baby, but are aware that it's going to be a lot of work. At first, my mother acted elated when we told her. She even made comments about how she was so glad we had a guest bedroom in our house so she could stay overnight to help care for the child. My mother is well aware that my husband and I could not afford a daycare right now and it would be very hard on us to have strangers raising our baby. We haven't heard much from my mother since other than a comment here and there about helping with the baby. Then just yesterday, I had a horrible day. My husband and I were fighting about money issues and a bunch of things went wrong that day, I finally broke down and called my mom crying for the first time in a very long time. We spoke for a little bit and then she had to go. She called me later that evening with my father on the phone with her and made a few passive aggressive comments about me not being a good mother in the future because I wasn't going to be a stay at home mom and that if my husband just worked harder and got another job he could support both of us. And the end of the conversation she added that she didn't think that she would ""have the time"" to help watch our baby two days a week and we should ""look into a daycare or nanny"" which she knows we can't afford. I feel flabbergasted and angry with my parents for being so cruel. I feel like they love the idea of having a grandbaby to play with and take pictures of, but don't want to help at all. Am I right for being angry with them? Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice? EDIT FOR FURTHER INFO: There are a lot of comments implying or just straight up saying that I am being entitled and ""forcing"" my parents to care for my responsibilities. Let me make it clear that there were conversations between my mother and I with EXPLICIT agreements about her taking care of the baby for 2 days a week while I was at work/school. I also DID NOT ASK her or imply that she had to. She called me and offered me the help then suddenly changed her mind and revoked the offer.

To be clear, his dad and gf are in the apartment, which is not super big. They didn't leave them... but I was a bit miffed by this. When I knocked on their bedroom door, my ex snapped something to the effect of ""what do you want?"" And I informed him I was there for my son. He shot out of bed and told me that they had had a really rough night with the 5 year old... ok. I can appreciate that.

636,is it ok to check the baby monitor at night? my husband says no.,"My husband and I have been married for 7 years. We have a 1 year old. We had a happy marriage until now.

Most of the time he is working at nights and weekends too. We had a great day today. After I put my 1yo to bed, he started crying. He is sleep trained and usually doesn't cry much. I panicked and said a few times why the child is crying. He said 'relax' a couple times. He was trying to convince me that he doesn't have a big problem, he will sleep soon. Of course he will sleep but I was curious about the reason for crying. Then our discussion escalated quickly. He said a bunch of things but the thing that hit me was this: He said I was checking the baby monitor too often. I checked it when he made a noise (which is correct). He says that if he wasn't crying no need to check the monitor. I strongly think that it is ok to check the monitor even if there is no noise. He is my baby, sleeping half of the day in his room on his own. It is my duty to check him through the monitor. What do you think? I really want to understand why he said that but our communication channels are broken now. We probably won't speak with each other about this. UPDATE: He fell asleep after 20 mins of struggling. Then he woke up screaming and crying after 1 hour. He never does that. I went into his room and checked everything. Something was wrong with his belly. He screamed when I laid him down on the changing station. Fast forward 2 hours, we ended up in the urgent care, he was constipated, and did not go since yesterday morning. He took a suppository.

638,Unplanned Talk With the Cruel Kid (the feces wiping/genital punching follow-up),"TL;DR I lost my temper a bit under odd circumstances and chastised someone else‚Äôs kid. How badly did I screw up? So an update on the event from the night before last‚Ä¶ the mom sent the son (that had coerced my son to slap himself repeatedly and punch his own genitals under threat that he would tear up one of his drawings) and his older sister down to my house unannounced with an apology letter. My wife was facilitating the delivery of the letter. I popped my head in the room in time to see/hear my oldest boy telling his friend how disappointed he was that he had treated his little brother like that. Then the kid laughs. I crossed the room, got on a knee, and used a serious tone that I don‚Äôt think this kid has gotten often. I was able to keep my anger in check enough to not raise my voice, but sadly that‚Äôs about it. These are the questions I asked him. ‚ÄúWhy are you laughing?‚Äù He answered that he thought my oldest son‚Äôs facial expression was funny. ‚ÄúDo you think there‚Äôs anything about this situation that should be funny?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you think your apology seems sincere when you‚Äôre laughing in the middle of it?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou were cruel to <youngest> and this is how you apologize?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you think that‚Äôs the type of kid that other kids want to play with?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you think that‚Äôs the type of kid I will let my kids play with?‚Äù I ended the barrage with telling him to look my son in the eye and reapologize. As they left my wife said she supported me but there would be a shitstorm fallout with the parents to follow. I didn‚Äôt understand why (because I‚Äôm an idiot) but I now realize that my temper probably got the best of me. I‚Äôm justifying an anger outburst (at a seven year old of all people) but I couldn‚Äôt sit there and watch this kid laugh during an apology for something so awful; not with both of my boys there to see. I asked my wife if I had raised my voice or yelled, she said no but my tone was severe and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs as probably a bit scary for this kid and his sister.",,False,False,parenting

642,"I love my 5am early riser of a toddler, especially on weekends <3","Preface- this is tongue-in-cheek and I am aware this was a fantastic ""problem"" to have. Pre-kiddo my biggest gripe with my marriage was that from 3am-10am on Sat+Sun I was alone.  I am a naturally light sleeper who excels on 3-4 hours a night.  For our entire marriage weekends were ""marred"" because I would get up at 3am, walk the dog, clean, cook, play video games, read etc.  and more and still end up alone for hours and hours until my lovely wife would get out of bed around 10/11am. Eventually I made friends who had dogs, and even joined an early rising ultimate frisbee club! But I really wished I had someone around the house to hang out with! Present Day: Our daughter is a little over 2 years old and has been awaking 5am on weekends.  I am THRILLED.  We sneak out like quiet little mice, go to cafe's, Walmart's, tractor stores, farms, yoga classes and MORE.  We pack a whole bonus day in each sat+sun before momma even wakes up.  She helps me scramble eggs and nearly every weekend for 4 months now she and I wake my wife up with fresh eggs and toast and coffee around 10am, in bed! I know this is not a question, and is more of a bragging post, but I am really happy with life and my kiddo right now, and wanted to share it.  This weekend she was extra sassy and needed a few more than usual time-in's.  I like watching her grow, her personality reminds me so much of my wife.  She's smart, much smarter than me at like a baseline level, just like her mom.  And so strong and cool.  She obviously meltsdown and tantrums like any toddler, but she is so open to re-direction, talking, expressing herself and more. Anyways.  I hope you all are having fun.

My daughter's other friend just found out it's a sleep over at a hotel. That's not normal right, to invite a bunch of 12yr old girls to a bday party and have no information? Tell me I'm not crazy, or is this a new way of parenting? Update: my daughter did not attend. The parent never did give out any additional information. Through the friend group it was determined they were meeting at the bday girl's house then going to the hotel. None of the parents to my knowledge were contacted with additional information. None of my daughter's close friends attended. They were just at a hotel party a few weeks ago, but all details were sent out ahead of time, and it was one of her best friend's party so we were very familiar with her mom. The hotel party doesn't bother me if I know the parents and know they'll supervise. I went to them a lot as a kid, and I completely understand wanting to not have a bunch of kids in your house. The mystery party had no details, no one knew what was going on, so when I had reached out to find out where the party was and got no answers, it was a no from me. If you're not responsible enough to answer another adult with pertinent information, you're not watching my child.

652,Bad sippy cup. I made my kid sick and I feel so guilty.,"I'm hoping for some reassurance that I'm not the only parent that has fucked this up. My son is 6 and on the autism spectrum. He has many developmental delays and still drinks from a sippy cup when we're on the go. While he is verbal, it's limited. He's never told us if something tastes bad or good. He seems unable to tell us anything about how he feels. Yesterday was the hottest day so far this year. So when he got off the school bus I had his cup topped off with ice and ready to go. We had errands to run including picking up Dad from work. About 2 hours later he started coughing. He just got over a cold and his coughing from that seemed to be done the day before. We kept telling him to drink more of his juice...then came the projectile vomiting. Had to pull off to the side of the road. Thank goodness I had the laundry in the car from my trip to the laundromat yesterday. Towels and a change of clothes. We had no idea what caused him to throw up, but it was very hot and when we asked ""do you feel hot or ok, buddy?"" He'd say ""feeling hot"". But we took that with a grain of salt since he also just copies the last thing you say. On the way home we kept encouraging him to drink more juice. We get home, he's looking lethargic and just wants to snuggle his Appa plush and lie on the couch... Then more vomiting. Got him in the shower and since it was getting late started to prep for bedtime. That's when I saw it. His sippy cup in his bed. We only had one in circulation (green in color) and I know I gave him one at bedtime. That was the ""good"" cup. This other one I found in the living room under the couch (also green) and topped it with ice before going down to the bus. I thought it was the same one from the morning... But now I realize his cup didn't come from the bedroom like it always does each morning. I had found a rogue cup half full of god knows how old Mio and water and bacteria and fed it to my kid. Encouraging him to drink more and more. Making him vomit for the 3rd time in his life. Scaring the heck out of him. I'm fucking horrible. I wish he had the words to tell me it tasted awful. I wish he had refused his cup. But instead he trusts us and kept drinking. This sucks so bad. Good news is he's not vomited since last night and other than a bit of lethargy and missing a school day he's fine.",,False,False,parenting
653,Question for parents who own guns,"My husband is a police officer, and he owns two guns that he keeps fully loaded in our home. We have had many arguments on this topic, and I would like other parent‚Äôs opinions. I don‚Äôt know much about guns, but the guns that he owns are both Glock pistols. He keeps one on his duty belt in the holster within our children‚Äôs reach (5 year old and 1 year old). He says that they are not able to remove it from the holster because they simply won‚Äôt know how. His duty belt hangs on his closet rod. The other one he keeps on our dresser in the case that it came in when he bought it that easily snaps open. It does not lock. That gun is loaded fully with a bullet in the chamber. He says that our children, specifically our 5 year old, are smart enough to not mess with them and that it‚Äôs apparently out of their reach. However, in 2019 I was in the shower and at the time our daughter was maybe 3 years old. He was not paying attention to her and she had drug a chair against the dresser and was playing with things on top of it. His gun was up there also in the case I mentioned earlier. After that incident, I got him a gun safe. He used it for awhile but now he is telling me that putting them in the gun safe is pointless because they need to be readily available if someone were to break in. He has since then given our gun safe away and has resorted to his old ways, because to him where they are is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù because he talks to our daughter about gun safety and she says she would never mess with them, and our 1 year old definitely can‚Äôt get to them as she is always fully supervised and can‚Äôt reach.

654,Am I not doing enough for my wife with our newborn?,"I'm writing this because my wife has been getting increasingly upset with me since our daughter was born, and I'm at a bit of a loss for what to do. Background: We just had a 7-week newborn (our first baby). It's been stressful, but our little one is an absolute dream and I love her beyond words. Knowing that taking care of a baby is a full-time job, I've been trying to do anything I can to help as a husband. My main responsibilities are doing all the household chores, cooking 3 meals a day for both of us, taking care of our 2 dogs, doing the errands/shopping, and working full time from home (she is currently a stay-at-home mom). I will typically hold our daughter for a couple of naps through the day/evening to give my wife a break and change diapers through the night while my wife breastfeeds. It's a lot, but I enjoy it and know my wife has to handle a screaming baby and the struggles of breastfeeding 24/7 so what do I have to complain about really! Fast forward to today, I come home from getting groceries while on a customer support call with Verizon to activate my new phone service. I hear the baby screaming and can sense my wife is stressed out. She comes into the office while I'm on with customer support and drops our daughter off with me and storms out. From this point, I had to hang up on customer service to console our baby but was eventually able to get her to sleep and put her down in the bassinet. Normally it wouldn't be a big deal if I wasn't in the middle of something but I was annoyed and afterward told my wife to consider asking me if it's a good time to watch the baby before doing that. She just responds with an annoyed ""Oh wow was that inconvenient for you"". Don't get me wrong, I love watching our child, I just didn't love that she put our crying baby on me during a phone call and walking out. She then proceeds to pack up all of her and our baby's things and move them into another room (normally baby sleeps in our master bedroom). I was able to talk to her briefly after and she explained that she didn't feel it was fair that I have time to make personal calls to set up my phone while she is struggling with the baby. I told her I'm always happy to hold/watch the baby if she needs time to take care of personal things but she basically shut down the conversation from there. If I am being honest, this event made me feel pretty bad because I've been trying very hard to offload as many external duties from her as I can.  It's clear that she is very stressed and I just don't know what more I can do to help. When I'm having a conversation with her she says that I am doing enough but these ""stress-induced"" arguments keep getting more frequent and worse. I am hoping other Moms or Dads with similar experiences here might help me out with ways I can help more or perhaps an insight into the situation. Thank you!  Edit: There are too many comments to respond to personally, but thank you all so much for the invaluable insight!! I'm reading them all. The support has been tremendous and has really helped my mental state in this situation. Just wanted to say that you all rock!",,False,False,parenting

Her kid comes toddling down the sidewalk, passes her apartment and just comes right on down to mine and takes up residence on my kid's tricycle. Her mom says, ""hi guys!"" And just goes into her apartment and shuts her door. No ""hey, can you watch my kid for a few"", no coming down with her child and having a conversation with me. Just....goes in, shuts the door. So I wait 5 minutes. Then 10. I'm confused as fuck. We've had polite conversations in the past, but I know nothing about her or her kid. Her kid doesn't even speak yet. We're as close as two acquaintances who say hi occasionally can be. I'm sorry, but I don't want to be responsible for two kids, especially a stranger's kid. 15 minutes go by. I'm fucking miffed by this point. I'm trying to get her child to walk back down to her mom's apartment and she's absolutely clung onto the tricycle.

658,Wife wants another baby. I don't. We might be at the end.,"I (40m) and my wife (36f) have a three-year-old. My wife has wanted a second child since she was pregnant with the first. I love our child to death, but we had an awful time of it when he was a newborn. I have no desire to start over, particularly the older I get; I'm emotionally  and physcially drained at the end of the day; I miss time for us and for me alone; it'd be very tough financially; etc. All the reasons people have for not wanting more kids, I'm there. She absolutely wants a second. It's been the biggest, longest fight of our relationship -- to the point that I have a hard time remembering that I think we were otherwise very happy together.  I finally agreed to try, and we got pregnant right away. I was depressed for months and just starting to come out of it when we lost the pregnancy at a very late date. The newborn should have been arriving just about now. We're both wrecked over the loss, but I don't want to start trying again and she only wants to have another child as a way to move on. I feel like I haven't gotten to grieve because we went back to fighting about trying for another kid almost immediately. She feels like I'm not sharing my grief with her, but, whenever I do, she immediately pivots to trying for another kid. She's said multiple times in the last few months that she can't see staying with me if we don't have another kid. Before you say it, we're in counseling. It doesn't feel like it's helping, and, after another round of fighting tonight, I don't know that it would. It's just such a fundamentally big choice. She absolutely wants another child. I absolutely don't. I get where she's coming from, but it doesn't change how I feel. I don't know that she gets where I'm coming from, but she's explicitly said it doesn't change how she feels. She won't even consider not having another kid. Between the loss and the ongoing fight, I'm not sleeping, work is slipping, and I'm venting on reddit instead of taking care of either. I'm at the point where I'm looking at an exit just to preserve my sanity -- scoping  a budget and housing as a single dad -- but  feeling physically nauseous about the potential loss of my family on top of everything else.

662,MIL will not spell my kid's name correctly and it's driving me insane.,"So, for about a year now, my MIL has been spelling my son's name incorrectly. His name isn't uncommon. Not highly common but, you probably know someone who has the name. It's also spelled in the traditional way. Nothing fancy. If his name was Tyler she would be spelling it Tylur. It's not a huuuuuge deal, but me and my husband have both told her on multiple occasions how to spell his name, she just refuses! I don't get it! He has stuff with his name on it that she's seen, held, and commented on. I know I can't stop her, but it's driving me mad every time I text her. I don't want to show her things because shes going to spell his name wrong... this is the end of my rant.",,False,False,parenting
663,Is this too mean to say to my 4 year old?,"We had my (f31) brother (m34) staying last weekend I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old. I was putting my 4 year old to bed and she asked me to read a really long book. I agreed but said that she needed to be ready for sleep after straight away as it was already 9.30pm. We read the whole book and straight away after she said ""I need a drink and a snack"". I'm not very strict with bedtime , especially when we have guests but I was frustrated at this time because I had been awake since 4am , and as much as I try to be gentle, I wasn't feeling it at that moment in time. We were walking down the stairs and I said ""honey, mammy feels frustrated. It is annoying that we were in bed and now we are making a snack. Mammy feels really annoyed that we could have read the book while you were eating, I want to go to bed"" My brother overheard and even though he admitted I was speaking in a friendly calm tone, he felt like I was a bad mom for telling my child that she was annoying me. She was though. Just an edit.. So my daughter is the type that if she gets overtired at all she doesn't fall asleep. So it is often quicker to restart routine than it is to sit and wait her out. Also we had a guest so she was distracted during the meal so I expected she was probably hungry. Also for those commenting it is too late, she used to go to bed at 7pm but daylight savings combined with partner not being home for the evenings has really messed our whole system up. She is currently on school break , but I know once they go back she will fall back to routine again Edit 2 I also really appreciate the perspective of the child not acting in a frustrating way that led me to feeling annoyed , but me not asserting my boundaries earlier. I am actually fine with giving a snack. Due to circumstances I think she actually was hungry. It is not something typically asked for so when she did say it I kind of thought ""fuck, I don't want to get up but she didn't like dinner much and was playing a joke game with my brother during supper , so probably didn't eat much & is probably hungry""",,False,False,parenting
664,Cops were called for letting child play at a playground,"The male version of a Karen called the cops today while I was at the park with my own child. I don‚Äôt subscribe to the parenting style of a helicopter parent because I have multiple children and I encourage their independence for the sake of practicality and growth. To him, my 19 month old seemed to be abandoned, yet he was within my sight at all times. When the man picked up my son, I walked over to intervene. Don‚Äôt touch someone‚Äôs child unless they fall and need help. It was then that I became uncomfortable with the environment and decided to leave. The man FOLLOWED us to my van and proceeded to rattle off my vehicle information to the police over the phone. I asked if I could help him and he said no. I also heard him say at this time that I appeared to be in a hurry to leave. Well, I was dude, you just picked up my kid and you‚Äôre a freaking stranger. Two officers pull in behind me almost immediately thereafter and asks me what‚Äôs going on? I told them the guy was out of line and should have asked around the park if he was truly concerned for the welfare of my child. He told them that my son had been unsupervised for an hour, but that wasn‚Äôt true because I was there the whole time. I never left the vicinity he just had no way of knowing who his mother was because I wasn‚Äôt up my kids ass protecting his every wobble like so many parents do today. I should add that if my 19 month old was my youngest child, I  would‚Äôve been, but I was sitting at the picnic tables breast-feeding my six-month. I didn‚Äôt notice that anyone was concerned about him, I just thought he was socializing with different people. The officer wasn‚Äôt concerned at all and told me to have a nice day. We live in rural middle America, not some of over-populated metropolis. I drove away feeling frustrated and concerned about the future that my kids will grow up in where everyone is over policed and overprotective. I recognize that male Karen in some of my neighbors who will not let their children play outside of their fenced in backyard. Unfortunately, those children are overweight and glued to a screen. In hindsight, I should‚Äôve told that guy to read the book Achtung Baby which addresses German parenting philosophies and explores different cultures and other versions of promoting childhood exploration, while referencing statistics that put the antecdotal ‚Äúmy child was almost kidnapped‚Äù Facebook evidence to shame. I hate feeling like I did something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù by taking my toddler to the park. Would you have called the police? Should I buy a fence? Or tell Mr. Karen to get bent? Edit: The man told police ‚Äúan hour‚Äù but I had changed my sons diaper exactly twenty minutes before (and changed his pants too) at which time I looked at my watch before sending him back to play again. If he had been observing, he would have seen my son come to me, or be wearing different pants, or have a clean face because I wiped his face after I changed him. Even though my son is 19 months, he wears 3t clothing, climbs stairs and slides down by himself and doesn‚Äôt cry when he falls unless he‚Äôs really injured. He‚Äôs a BIG, tough kid.‚Äî over 11lb at birth! I don‚Äôt judge parents for deciding helicoptering is their style. I‚Äôm just frustrated that those same parents expect that to be my style too. I get the feeling this fellow parent (yes he did have one daughter at the park with the assistance of his wife and dog) judged me immediately based on one look at my seemingly ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù child. Just because I‚Äôm not following my child around doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not as precious to me as those who keep their children closer. Room to explore leaves my children room to grow and promotes resilience, a healthy attachment, self-determining boundaries, and an overall sense of confidence. Other parents prefer a stronger attachment bond and more dependence from their children and that‚Äôs their choice. No judgment from me AT ALL so don‚Äôt get triggered if I perceive you as being up your kids ass!",,False,False,parenting
665,I don‚Äôt want to be a mom anymore,"I do love my child. She is 18 months old. But I never wanted to be a mom. I have depression and a few other issues. And I was groomed by her dad at 17 when he was 33, and I had her when I was 19 and he was 35. I tried several times to put her up for adoption when I was pregnant but my parents and her dad told me not to and I listened. But this is going terribly. She screams and cries all the time. And then she can sense my frustration because her crying triggers my flight response. I am not a good mother and recently her dad assaulted me and broke my phone so there is a no contact order. I don‚Äôt have his help anymore and my parents are an hour away. I could leave her with her dad but he is abusive towards others (not her) so I‚Äôm a bit afraid. Or I could leave her with my parents but their living situation is not optional (living in a tiny house) and my dad is verbally abusive to my mom and has anger issues (not physical). All I know is I really don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. And its sad. The whole situation is so messed up and dysfunctional. I just want the best for her. UPDATE: I left my daughter with my parents for several days and took her back when I felt better. My friend came over and helped me clean my apartment and organize. I also bought groceries. I‚Äôm still struggling with depression and her behaviors but taking my meds makes me feel a lot better. Hopefully its all uphill from now on but I have realized that uncomfortable feelings are ok and you shouldn‚Äôt hide from them. I‚Äôm also buying a gentle parenting book online like someone suggested. My parents will take her on the weekends so I can have some time to recoup. His mom messaged me asking me my opinion on filing a motion to drop the no contact order against him for my daughter ONLY so that they can pick her up and drop her off. But I don‚Äôt know about that.

Parents of children/ adult children with Down Syndrome or siblings of a person with Down Syndrome, we would love to hear the good, bad and ugly of this diagnosis.

671,In defense of rude children,"Look yall, be honest, am I wrong here? My daughter (4F) is the strong silent type and always has been. She's sweet as pie if she knows you, is polite in restaurants and to cashiers but she's very honest about her disdain for other people. She worships her brothers (5m and 8m ) and cousins and calls them her best friends and calmly informs anyone that asks that she doesn't want anyone else. To the point: Today we were at the vet getting a new kitten from our rescue shots and a little girl about her age walked up to chat. I chatted with the little girl and let her pet the kitten and then she turned to my daughter and asked if she wanted to be friends. My daughter calmly told her ""No thank you I don't want friends I don't really like people"". The little girl took it in stride and went back to petting the kitten before returning to her mom. I was initially mortified and talked to her about being polite and kind and she was like ""I was kind and polite but I don't want to be friends. I'm happy with my brother friends and cousin friends"" Later I thought it was funny and was chatting with a mom group and everyone was mortified. ""My child loves everyone and would be crushed by a response like that"". Etc. Etc. At first I felt bad but then I started getting a little angry.

I thought she was a good student, but yesterday she spouted some nonsense about the ‚Äúfive‚Äù oceans and ‚Äúeight‚Äù planets.  Come to think of it, she hardly even brings any books to or from school.  Last week she turned down her favorite lunch ‚Äî a peanut butter sandwich ‚Äî under some fabricated excuse that the school doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúallow‚Äù them. She‚Äôs never watched Saturday morning cartoons.  No friends call the house asking to talk to her.  Yesterday she refused to help me find my new car‚Äôs missing radio antenna and CD player.

She was happily sucking her favourite pacifier, humming away, when we were approached by two neighborhood kids, about 10 years old. I know their parents well, so they said hello. Then, one said, ""My mom never let me have a pacifier... it ruins your teeth."" The other chimed in, ""Yeah, same here. The plastic is bad for you."" I'm just so thankful they let me know... I ripped that pacy out of my daughter's mouth right away, and canned the rest of them the moment I got home.

692,Proud dad moment here,"Yesterday, while visiting out of town friends with older kids, I had a heart melting moment that I thought I‚Äôd share. After some days of rain, us parents were trying to get the older kids outside to burn off some energy, after they had spent 27 hours/day on their iPads. Our friends have a 8yo girl and a 4yo boy. Ours is a 2yo boy. I decided to make some challenges for the two older kids, to get them exercising. Their house sits atop a hill with some gullies on either side, so I thought some hill races would be perfect to burn energy. One of the challenges was to have them run down the sidewalk, around the driveway loop (their driveway makes a teardrop loop like a cul-de-sac with a garden in the center), then back to the house. The driveway teardrop is on a hill, the farthest side behind the garden is a steep hill and hidden from view by the garden, the closer side is a shallower grade uphill. This was a time trial race so the kids wouldn‚Äôt get discouraged with each other. The 4yo wanted to go first so we did the proper countdown and away he went. 40 seconds later he returned, excited as could be. Next went the 8yo. She took off like a shot from a canon. Racing down the sidewalk I briefly noticed my 2yo following her giggling as he trotted down the sidewalk as well. The 8yo rocketed down the far side of the driveway and we could barely see her head as she took a wide turn at the bottom, and charged back up the hill. Her mother and I were amazed at how fast she was moving that we didn‚Äôt notice my 2yo at all. She raced back up the sidewalk and crossed the line at an astonishing 18 seconds. When it was all over I turned to my wife and asked ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs our 2yo‚Äù? To which she replied ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs playing  around the end of the house‚Äù. Just then, at that very moment, my son emerged around the turn at the bottom of the hill. The sun was high above, and it illuminated his white blonde hair like a moviestar. He had the biggest, shit-eating-est, grin on his face I‚Äôd ever seen. He was so happy to be running and playing the same game as the older kids, that it completely melted my heart. I started jumping up and down and cheering him on as he trudged back up the hill and down the sidewalk across the finish line, where we all met him with cheers and high fives! 57 seconds! A world record in the 2yo grouping!! More than half of his lifetime has been spent isolated from children and adults as this pandemic ran its course, and I could not have been more proud to see him happy and trying, in his best effort, to play with the older kids!",,False,False,parenting
693,‚ÄòBoy moms‚Äô,"Disclaimer: I have a daughter and most people I know have all sons or a mix, so I might be super biased and am more than willing to hear I‚Äôm wrong.

Some people are taking this super personally or implying that I‚Äôm ‚Äòattacking‚Äô moms of boys - that‚Äôs really not the intent behind the question.

700,Playground incident with a kid with a developmental disability.,"My 2.5 year old and I were hanging out at the park earlier today. She climbed to the top of a high slide and was in the process of mustering up the courage to go down, when another kid, who was maybe 14 or 15 years old, followed her up. He appeared to have a cognitive disability, and was very gentle, but he wrapped his hands around her tummy, trying to slide with her. My daughter winced, pushed him a bit, and then froze as he forced them down. She's not big on touching- sometimes even by me. Usually she can assert her boundaries, and we always respect them when she does. But she just froze and looked at me. I didn't know what to do or if I should say something, because the kid's parents were there and it must be incredibly hard for them to navigate these circumstances as well.  I decided to just move to another area of the playground, but he followed her up there as well and was being kinda touchy.The kid was clearly well-intentioned and, heck, even trying to be helpful. But I don't know. Something about a stranger, slightly mustached, touching my daughter made me feel queasy. I might be projecting my own thing/experiences onto the situation, but we ended up just leaving. In the car I coached her about what to say when someone is making her feel uncomfortable (""Stop please"" etc).I just feel confused overall and angry at my inaction. Should I have spoken up for my daughter? Or am I overreacting? Should I have been more charitable towards the kid?",,False,False,parenting
701,Things to tell new parents to make them feel better about their parenting mistakes‚Ä¶,"Every parent will make mistakes and I‚Äôve seen many a new mom lament over a little bump or bruise that her toddler gets from little accidents like falling from the sofa or running into something.

This is my mother of all doozy, at least you didn‚Äôt do this, parenting fail story‚Ä¶ When my second child was about 6 months old my husband went to get a medical procedure. We had to travel a couple hours away for the procedure and decided to just stay for the weekend. We got a nice little 2 bedroom apartment, so he could recover in one room while I slept in the other room with our 2 boys. My eldest son (about 3 yrs old at the time) had an issue where he often threw up in the middle of the night, so he regularly slept in my room anyways. He would make a special kind of cough and cry that signaled I had about 30 seconds to get him to the toilet before he vomited. Around midnight I awoke to that special sounding cough/cry and jumped into action. I picked up my toddler and ran into the dark hallway. The bathroom was at the end of the hall and I had to move fast if we were going to make it. The hallway was pitch black, I could barely see a thing. I‚Äôm holding my son like he‚Äôs super man, so at least if we don‚Äôt make it he‚Äôll throw up on the floor and not all over me, but we‚Äôre going to make it. We‚Äôre almost to the bathroom‚Ä¶ and thats when we hit it. The door! The bathroom door that I had specifically left open in case we needed to run for it was closed. My husband had gotten up to use the toilet and closed the door afterwards. I had run into the door with my toddler like a battering ram. I screamed out as we hit and was immediately covered in warm wetness. I howled and cried that I had killed my son.  There was blood everywhere. He was dead. I knew he was dead. He just had to be. I had rammed him at full speed into a solid door like a medieval battering ram. My husband rushes into the hall and finds me sobbing over my toddlers body. I‚Äôm hysterical‚Ä¶ too hysterical to notice that my dead son is crying in my lap and that were covered in spaghetti vomit and not blood. He‚Äôs alive and thankfully not so much hurt as he was shocked. As I ran into the door with him I must have moved my hand over his head because his head was okay, but my hand was really busted up. The force of impact and velocity of the vomit made the hallway look like a crime scene. Speaking of crime scene‚Ä¶ It was a warm, late autumn evening so we had gone to sleep with the windows open. The apartment building was full of other weekend guests with their windows open as well. NO ONE called the cops on us. I know other guest heard me. I was sobbing and screaming that I killed my child and not a single person called the cops about it. So that‚Äôs it.

706,"We love our friends, but their horrible parenting is ruining our children too. What to do?","My wife and I are at the end of the rope with this conundrum we find ourselves in so I come to you fine people for unbiased opinions. Back Story: My wife and I were and are good friends with this other couple before we all had kids. We would go do your typical adult fun things all the time‚Ä¶ the other husband and I would go do man things and the girls would have their girls nights and no one ever skipped a beat. They were the first to have a child which more or less started the baby fever amongst our group of friends and fast forward 5 years, we all have multiple children and life is generally good. The current issue: The kids are now at the age where we as parents need to set limits and be firm to make sure the rules are adhered to, different people have different ways to do that. The issue here is that our friends let their kids run the show entirely. They cave to every want and wish their kids have for any reason. These kids know that all they have to do is have a tantrum long enough and loud enough and it‚Äôs a matter of time before the parents cave and they get what they want. It is a complete free-for-all and here are specific examples: They have tantrums when the dinner menu isn‚Äôt what they want and they throw the food everywhere until they are given what they want, which they always do without fail. Like‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt want to eat chicken nuggets, they want a buffet of candy instead. On outings, the kids want whatever trinket is being sold on the vendor cart. They‚Äôll make a huge embarrassing scene until the parents cave and give it to them. Which they always do. Both kids refuse to go to bed until they are damned good and ready which means that bed time isn‚Äôt until 2 am most nights in their house. The older one curses.

When one of the other kids is starting down the road of morphing in satan‚Äôs spawn, my son is only a few minutes behind and the day is ruined. It then takes a full day of war in our home to pull our son out of the literal demon possession that he was led into by the other kid.

I thought that if I could just pray with more sincerity, read the scriptures more often, be a better wife, a better mother, and serve my Church ward faithfully, my feelings of unhappiness and marital unease would go away. None of that stopped my husband from leaving our family. My kids have been through so much, my heart breaks for them.

We downsized earlier this year and I got rid of the Christmas d√©cor to save space, foolishly thinking that I would just purchase something else when the time came that accommodated the size of our new apartment. When it became apparent that I wasn‚Äôt returning to the Church, my friends and the few family members I still spoke to faded from my life. The only thing more frustrating and embarrassing than not being able to afford Christmas is not having anyone around you to ask for help. When it started to look like I wouldn‚Äôt have enough this year I started to search for a place that offered donated gifts. I live in a pretty small town, and I was only able to find a toy drive for children much younger than mine. I‚Äôve had a constant knot in my stomach wondering how I‚Äôm going to face my kids and explain that we‚Äôre not going to be able to decorate a tree, put up Christmas lights, nor will they be receiving any gifts. I‚Äôve cried on the way to work every day last week; I don‚Äôt look forward to today‚Äôs drive either. I keep imagining their faces in my head, sometimes with disappointment and sadness, sometimes with anger. I‚Äôve tried to think of questions they‚Äôll inevitably ask and I‚Äôm still struggling to come up with answers. The only thing I can think to say is that this isn‚Äôt a punishment, that I love them dearly, and that next year will be different. My mind can‚Äôt help but drift to the worst possible scenarios and I‚Äôm afraid that this will be the thing to push them over the edge. I‚Äôm going to distract my kids as much as I can. We‚Äôre going to play board games, tell stories, go to the park, let them style my hair in whatever crazy way they want, make a couch fort, play outside, and spend as much time together as possible. I know it won‚Äôt be the same, my kids love Christmas and the holidays in general, but I‚Äôm not going to let my ex‚Äôs bad decisions (or mine, for that matter) bring my family any more heartache than it has to. I wish I had a few good friends to support me through this, it‚Äôs been a lot to bare lately. I‚Äôve had moments where I thought I was going to completely break down. I discovered Reddit while researching ex-Mormons and it‚Äôs been one of the only places I can really vent my feelings, so thank you to everyone on this site who‚Äôve taken the time to listen to me. Hopefully we can weather this storm and start fresh come the new year. Happy holidays to you all.",,False,False,parenting
715,My 6 year olds grandmother is giving her Tylenol to help her sleep,"My 6 year olds dad isn‚Äôt present in her life, but his mom still gets her every other weekend. I‚Äôve always had issues with her doing things without my consent. For instance I‚Äôve told her I don‚Äôt want my child‚Äôs hair cut and the one time I said she could cut an inch off they took off well over 6 inches. We‚Äôve let her stay up and watch tv so her sleep schedule was off during summer.

717,Weirdest Sleepover Ever,"UPDATE: She texted me this morning asking how much she owes me for the food I gave them! I rounded down a tad, but let's see if I actually get it. ==== So my second grader has a friend on her bus that she absolutely adores, who sent her mom's phone number home before break. I was holding off on any unnecessary exposures before Christmas with family, and then my husband brought covid home from work toward the end of break. We're all finally healthy, so Thursday I texted the girl, ""Leslie's"", mom, suggesting we set up some sort of play date. Friday, in the middle of a hellish workday, she texts me back, asking me could Leslie and her little sister, Andrea (preschool age) come sleep over at our house. My youngest is close in age, so I was open to the idea, but asked if we could move it to Saturday because I was way too burned out that day to take it on. I also asked if I could ask my husband first. She responded, ""Are my girls coming over tomorrow, yes or no?"" I was still trying to deal with drama at work, so I gave up and just said yes. Got her address, set a time to pick them up, ignored her hints that I should also take her youngest kiddo, a boy, too. As it was, my husband was working all day Saturday and Sunday, so I knew I'd be doing it all on my own. Before I can settle back into work, she texts me asking if I can bring some food and juice for her kids because their food stamps don't come through until the 8th. I literally have never spoken to this woman before, but now she's having me pick up two of her kids and wants food? But I feel bad for the kids in this situation, so I put together a bag of food for them anyway. At this point, I was getting seriously nervous they just weren't going to be there when we went to drop them off today and I'd just have two more kids. So I agree to the food, and pick up the girls. I want to say, they were both wonderful. Polite, sweet, well behaved (the younger had a few moments, but nothing out of the ordinary for that age). The mother never even asked my last name or my address. Then, throughout the 24 hours they were here, she texted me almost hourly updates about what they were doing at home, and asked for more food? She did video chat with the girls before bedtime and in the morning, and I made sure I fed them lunch before taking them home. We had fairly standard ""nobody is going to sleep until after midnight"" sleepover issues, mostly with the youngest wanting to play. I'm a pushover in general, and I was so distracted on Friday that I didn't have the mental strength left to push back at all, but she's already dropping hints that we could watch all three kids for them more often so they could have date nights. I'm obviously going to need to set boundaries, but I'm just so weirded out by this whole experience (and exhausted, because I slept in the living room with my own preschooler since she was NOT sleeping in her room with the other girls). This isn't normal, right? Now I really want to keep an eye on and be a resource for these girls if they need it, but I want to avoid their mom. I partly needed to vent about all of this, but also kind of wondering if I'm missing something here. Edit: I wasn't so much wondering if it was weird, but trying to figure out what kind of weird dysfunction this is. It's definitely not a dynamic I've run across before. Thanks for all the ideas and suggestions, I'm definitely going to need to toughen up and set some boundaries.

718,My child's friend's parents are nosey and entitled.,"I'm a single parent with just one child. It's just her and I. 5  years ago my daughter met her best friend, and then about 2 years in her best friend's parents started asking if they could have her for all the holidays. On top of that, I found out that those same parents started pushing their religion onto my child. A few weeks ago the mom texted me, saying her child was demanding to see mine, which I was shocked by since her bestie knew we were extremely ill. When I asked my daughter about this she informed me that her bestie had said nothing like this to her mom. Today the mom texted me again saying the same thing, which again seemed odd since my daughter just found out she has a heart condition and can't run around, and just like before her friend is aware. My daughter doesn't want to tell anyone else, so I don't know how to tell the mom that she's not able to hang out. I also don't understand why she's pushing so hard.",,False,False,parenting
719,Is it wrong to ask my husband not to eat certain foods around our kids?,"My husband is an extremely picky eater and it's hard to find healthy foods that he likes. When we first started dating he never cooked. His diet basically consisted of pasta, grilled cheese, and pizza. I was never taught to eat healthy foods by my parents but it's something I taught myself and is very important to me. We have two young children who I do not want to have his eating habits. So when I cook dinner I ask him to sit down and eat with us (I always try to make sure there is at least a side he likes so he has something) because I feel like that's good quality family time. And then when I'm reading to the kids before bed he can eat whatever he wants. I'm not trying to control what he eats but I also now my kids will choose those foods if it's an option. Am I being to controlling of my husband? Edit: To clarify my kids to eat meals of all kinds for dinner. Sometimes that's pizza and other times it's something more nutritious. I simply don't want them eating that every night. I do not believe my husband has an eating disorder and neither does he. He told me that as a kid his mom made him whatever he wanted to eat and that's why he feels he is so picky because she never tried new things. I litterally went through as many dishes I could think of to try to broaden what he likes. Majority of things he had never tried some of which he did try and other he didn't want to even try.  Which is how I can usually incorporate something. My husband never objected to eating whatever he wanted after the kids go to bed it's just something I kind of felt guilty asking him.",,False,False,parenting

721,"""Most guys just aren't good with kids""","This statement has been ringing in my head over and over. My wife and I went to a graduation party for her coworkers child. We brought our 6 month old daughter (only child right now). We sat down with 4 of her coworkers (all female) and one husband. My wife had to go to the bathroom so she handed me our daughter. I began to bounce her around, talk to her, point out stuff. Things that I felt to be...normal to do with a child. ""You're pretty hands-on with her."" the husband says with nonverbal agreement from the rest of the people at the table. ""Was it harder or easier than you thought it would be?"" ""Easier for sure."" I answered. ""I was worried but it felt natural after a few days."" I answered the question, but the statement about me being ""hands on"" based off 5 minutes of...being a parent felt weird. My wife returned. The husband catches her with a ""You're really lucky. Most guys just aren't good with kids. They're not hands on like he is."" My wife and I exchange a quick glance confirming each others' confusion with the premise while panning the group of coworkers that are silently agreeing. Is this where we're at as a culture? Empty platitudes about how men just ""aren't good with kids""? Is the expectation for fathers so low that the mere act of interacting with my daughter is seen as an accomplishment that merits a statement at all, let alone telling my wife how ""lucky"" she is? This certainly isn't a one-time thing either; my wife and I have read stories about ""aloof"" fathers in subreddits and Facebook groups. We're heard the stories firsthand from friends and coworkers. Why? Why is this just casual accepted as a fact? I'm sure it has roots in the out-of-date family dynamic where the man works and the woman stays at home and raises the kids. I was raised in an environment like that and don't feel any sort of innate desire to shirk the responsibilities of raising my child. I'm sure that any fathers reading posts in this subreddit are unlikely to be like the ones that I'm talking about. But it's confounding.",,False,False,parenting

Ten years ago today, in the middle of the night, I put on my nicest suit and filled the bathtub with cold water.  I dimmed the lights in the bathroom and put my laptop in the corner to quietly play looped recordings of a string quartet and crowd noises.  I went to my daughter's room and woke her gently, telling her that the Captain wants us up on deck.  I carried her to the bathroom, yelled ""Iceberg, right ahead!"" and dropped her in the tub.  Then I climbed in with her and we sat there shivering and talked about how scary it must have been, one hundred years ago that night.  Then I helped her out, dried her hair, and sent her off to change her pajamas and go back to bed.  I had told my wife I was going to do it, but she never believed I would.  I had made quite a mess to clean, all by myself in a soaking wet three-piece suit in the middle of the night. My little girl's in college now, and she's outgrown her obsession with the Titanic, but she still tells this story to everyone.  She rolls her eyes when she does, but she smiles.

While we love each other, it feels like we argue far too often about ‚Äúindoctrinating‚Äù our son. Before we even started dating, I felt I was incredibly intentional in explaining my faith and world view. He knew I went to church every week, I even invited him to church, and he knew that everyone in my family and extended family were Christians. He said he respected that. He seemed to be very curious and respectful, until I was pregnant. While I understand his perspective, I feel at a loss that ever since my pregnancy I feel he‚Äôs completely against my faith. I almost can‚Äôt open my mouth about it around him without him getting worked up and having something better to say.

One may see that as a negative and cliche, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm not allowed to believe it anymore. To be forced not to explain my beliefs to my son feels like a violation of who I am. I don‚Äôt expect my husband to keep his beliefs to himself, I just don‚Äôt want him to actively teach our son that my beliefs aren‚Äôt real.

735,"Husband threatened to leave because I told him to ""suck it up"" with regretting our 4yo","After being together for a few years, and married for 2, and enjoying our nieces and nephews, my husband and I decided in our mid thirties that it was time to become parents. Our child was born in early 2017. I will use gender neutral language to refer to them for privacy reasons. We have both found parenthood to be a disappointing and unfulfilling experience that is not what we expected in a number of ways. Perhaps the worst is learning that even though we love our child, the sacrifices are not worth it, and that the fulfilling and happy moments are so minimal compared to the work and sacrifices. We wish we stayed the cool aunt and uncle with money and freedom. But with the help of therapy, I have accepted that I made a wrong, but irreversible choice. I get how my husband feels. I really do. I love my child, but hate the job and lifestyle of being a parent. If I could wind back the clock, I‚Äôd have never become a mother, but I have to accept that there are no take back on my choice and I have a moral obligation to do the best by my child. But lately, his regret has become so consuming that he is impossible to deal with, and has become a lot less helpful with our child. I‚Äôm just sick of hearing about how much he hates being a Dad, and our child is getting to the age where they will understand what he is saying if they overhear it, and while I regret it too, I will take it to the grave and NEVER let my child know.

I get it, because I hated my maternity leave year, but I‚Äôm sick of him thinking that regretting it means he gets to wake up, log into work, eat dinner and climb back into bed, and spend all weekend moping in bed about hating his life. It is Father‚Äôs Day in our country and our child was was so excited to make him breakfast and he had just such a terrible attitude that our child asked me ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with Daddy?‚Äù.

736,Recorded my child and shared with another parent‚Ä¶,"Question for the masses: Am I wrong to be upset (for several days) that my child (8) was having a private conversation with another child (8) and the mother recorded it via her Ring and shared it with other parents?

I don‚Äôt really care about the juvenile conflict, children have conflicts all the time.. it‚Äôs normal and healthy.

Thankfully I got pregnant with our first baby the first time we tried. My doctors were amazed. I had a beautiful, easy pregnancy. While suffering from PPD with my first baby, I discovered my love for working out. I've been going 5 times a week and it has drastically changed my depression. I'm happier and stronger. I want to continue working out while I'm pregnant with baby number 2. My husband wants me to stop going to the gym once we start trying. He said he couldn't live if we had a miscarriage.

738,Toddler possibly hospitalized for Covid. Im with a newborn and cant stop crying,"Update: thanks everyone for the encouragement and support. I'm feeling better now after a good cry (ok, maybe a few of them). My husband is a great dad and as some of you pointed out, he is fully capable of taking care of my son, even though with all that's been going on, he is running on fume too. I havent read all of your comments yet, because some of them made me cry again (blame the hormones!) But I appreciate each and every one of them,  I really needed the reminder that my son is getting the help he needs and we will get through this, so I sincerely thank you all for that! Original post: The day I went in labor, my husband took my son to his doctor because of a fever. They then stayed home trying to take care of each other while I was in the hospital. The day we got discharged, my husband got a call that my son tested positive for covid. The past couple of days he refused food and drank very little, and got weaker by days. I quarantined myself with the newborn in our bedroom but still cant help running out whenever I have a chance to force liquid down his throat, to try and get him to play, to just hold him. Whatever I can do to make it better, even just a little bit. Then last night I asked my husband when he last changed his diaper. We realized that he had one wet diaper all day, which is bad. This morning husband took him to the ER, and now they are saying he may have to be hospitalized. When I heard that my son cried but let the nurses put an IV on his arm, my heart broke. Because his normal self would have put up a serious fight.  his lack of protest just proved how weakened he is. I know, because I was there for every single doctor visit. This time though, Im not. When he needed me the most, I cant be there. The few days I was in the hospital was the first time he's away from me for that long. We tried to video chat and all he did was grabbing the phone and crying for me. I have never felt so helpless in my life and Im questioning every single decision we made. My husband and I both tested negative so its highly likely that he got it from daycare. And he did have covid previously, but back then we weren't sure where he got it from. Since then we have been extra careful, got vaccinated ourselves too. The only thing I did not do, was finding a way for him to stay home. he did so well in daycare and learning so much. And now I'm just questioning my sanity for getting him exposed. Idk why Im writing this. I just don't know what else I can do aside from crying alone waiting for any updates.",,False,False,parenting

He barley says hello to her. If she wants to play with him, her dad, he turns her down or worse yells at her. He dismisses her and rejects her constantly. All she has ever seen of her dad is yelling and annoyance. I have spent the entire day crying as a result of an issue with her school and when I asked if he could help me, like usual he said no. I though for a second and realized that me staying here, trying to keep a ""family unit"" for my daughter isn't working. I know what it's like to grow up without a father and I thought by staying around and being this man's slave and doing everything for him and my daughter and never taking care of myself that I was doing her a service because her dad would be in her life. The kind of dad she has sucks. He just sucks. He is such a waste of resources, money, attention and everything else. I cannot stand him. We separated today. An hour ago. We are stuck in the same house until July but I have never felt better. Side comment he said to me ""the reason my daughter doesn't like me is because you say bad things about me to her"" like no dude, you treat her like shit and your super fucking mean. I don't like you either. Sorry if this is the wrong sub or format. I'm just so upset and this parenting shit is so hard but its 10x harder when I'm parenting a grown ass man and a child all the time and then being harassed and bullied on top of it.

As far as I know, she has no friends in her classes. Nobody talks to her. She eats alone on the hallway floor, a lunch I made at home because she's too afraid to go into the cafeteria to buy anything. In elementary she had tons of friends but as soon as they went to grade 8 at the high school, cliques broke up and kids found other interests and grew apart. Mine discovered online gaming and that was the end of that, all her ""friends"" are online people. I am not at all concerned about this. She is just introverted, always has been, no big deal. The teenage years are horrid, I remember them well. She'll find her way. We spend a lot of time with our kids so I know she's safe, well rounded, smart, computer savvy, just likes what she likes and that's cool. Today she told me that her English teacher lets them watch movies in her classroom at lunch break. This started a few weeks ago, I guess. So far they have watched all of The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, and are now watching the Planet of the Apes movies. There are 6 or 7 people there regularly, and even one girl she knows.

Since last year, she has started using Tik Tok more and more. Even after the events of the self harm video that went on. The end of last month, during my wife's birthday (which I wanted to be a good day) I started to shut down and distance myself from her and my daughter because she let our daughter watch Tik Tok in the mall while we walked to some stores. While we ate dinner she asked me why I was acting like that and I told her that Tik Tok is not for children. I put my heart and soul into explaining that the app is for adults ONLY and children, especially mine, should not be subjected to that content. She seemed like she understood and said she wouldn't let her be on it. I told her I had my doubts because she doesn't follow through when she says she is going to set boundaries. She tends to be a helicopter parent that let's our daughter do whatever she wants, because then my daughter is happy and will like her (duh). Well today she gave her the phone to let her talk to her cousins. Fine. But after she was done, she went right to Tik Tok. My wife knew I would be upset, but instead of saying no she said ""daddy will be angry if you use that."" She preceded to use it anyway. I looked at her waiting to see if she was going to tell her no, but she said ""come here, we are going to look together"" I said it's not acceptable, she shouldn't be on it at all. She said it's fine, because she's there monitoring her. I am at my breaking point! I am ready to throw the phone out the window! I told her if she keeps using it, I won't be a part of the weekend. I won't do anything at all. Well she ignored me and just kept letting her use Tik Tok. I don't know what to do. I'm at my wit's end. I am trying to be calm about this, but it turned into a screaming match (which I hate myself for. I don't like to argue in front of my daughter). So I went into my bedroom while I try to compose myself, and I wrote this in hopes someone could give me advice. Am I in the wrong? I feel like even though my wife is monitoring what she's watching, it's not good enough. You can't know what is coming up next. How do I approach this situation calmly and find a solution? I am genuinely worried about the effect this will have on my daughter. Sincerely, A very concerned dad Edit: To those who believe I am placing blame, that is not the intention. I told the story the way it happened, with my mistakes included. My goal is not to hear 500 people say ""I'm right, she's wrong"". We both made mistakes. I made this post with complete honesty. I could have left out things and painted the picture I wanted. The goal is advice for the betterment of my child. Edit 2: My wife came up to be and told me it's hard for her to say she was wrong, but she was. She said I was right, and I immediately told her I promise this is not about who is right or wrong, this is about our daughter. The 1300 upvoted comment was the wake-up call she needed to realize our child should not be on Tik Tok, along with many other comments with that same sentiment. Thank you everyone who took part in giving their thoughts. We still plan on co-parenting class, but at least for now she will do better on not letting her on Tik Tok or her phone.

I get dressed all by myself and then I go downstairs very quietly so you can sleep. Then I turn the TV on to something you like. Not your scary show, but a cooking show. Or Abby Hatcher. No! GABBY Dollhouse. Yeah. Then I get some eggs and open them in a bowl. Then I put them in the pan and get my iPad so I won't be bored. Then I put the eggs on a plate, but not a glass plate, a baby plate so it won't break. Then I go upstairs and wake you up. I want you to sleep a lot so you won't be tired and you can play your computer game."" She also loudly whispered to her dad that she needed to be super extra good and listen to Mommy.

I feel like I've actually been doing this parenting thing right. And I know this isn't every day... But the fact that she thinks I like Abby and Gabby, or that she thinks scrambled eggs take so long to cook that she'll get bored but she wants to do it anyway, or that she wants me to have enough energy to actually play my own games...

766,5 year old refusing to acknowledge new baby,"I have 3 children, oldest Miss A (8), Miss B (5), and Baby Brother (9 mths). Miss B is refusing to even acknowledge even exists. It started when we told our girls we were expecting another baby. Miss A was over the moon about the news, Miss B was blank faced at first and then burst into hysterical crying. Then we tried to include them both in a gender reveal, Miss B refused to participate and threw a huge tantrum. Then Baby arrived and she outright refused to come to the hospital to meet him. When I returned home with the baby, she refused to meet him then either. She sat in her bedroom upstairs until she came downstairs saw Miss A, Baby, Hubby, and me looking and talking to the baby. I asked her if she wanted to join us and meet the baby, but she just gave me a blank stare and went back up stairs. The first time I ever bucked her in next to him, she gave me the foulest look the whole car ride. That happened once and now she just stares out the window and refuses to talk. If baby is not in the car, she acts like a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù child and is very talkative. When I was pregnant with Miss B, I read so many articles online to get Miss A ready for the the birth of Miss B and it went so smoothly. I just don‚Äôt know what went wrong this time around. I got a baby doll while I was pregnant, I got her a ‚Äúgift from the baby‚Äù, I asked her if she wanted to pick out something for the babies nursery. I tried my hardest to include her in every way I could but she was having none of it. Whenever the baby was mentioned, she would either change the subject or leave the room. I‚Äôve tried to read up on it, but the only thing I can find online is children acting out, or throwing tantrums. She doesn‚Äôt do that, she just gives me a blank stare, changes the subject, or just blatantly leaves mid conversation if the baby comes into the room. Family and friends think she has autism and that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs acting the way she is, but she shows no other symptoms or behaviours of autism. I‚Äôve tried asking her why she‚Äôs doing it, if she hates him, etc but she ignores every question. I‚Äôm just at a loss of what to do and my family is starting to question what‚Äôs going on. I don‚Äôt want her to become an adult who still refuses to accept her brother EDIT: just to add because it‚Äôs been asked a couple of times, my husband and I do spend 1 on 1 time with each of the older girls on the weekends, usually we don‚Äôt bring up the baby during that time.

767,Son is bring bullied at school and I am livid,"(second attempt at posting) Jonah (9, not his real name) is adopted, along with his two siblings. My husband and I adopted them out of foster care two years ago. As the oldest, and the one with the most memory of the revolving door of homes and the times he couldn‚Äôt be placed with his siblings, the one who was vomiting from stress the one time he broke a plate and thought we‚Äôd send him away, he‚Äôs always had attachment issues and always been easier to set off than the other children. It doesn‚Äôt help that he‚Äôs smaller than most of the other children and is shy and introverted. The other day Jonah came home from school and went straight to his room. I came up to ask him how school was and he answered in monosyllables. I knew he‚Äôd been having trouble with the other kids, so I asked him about it and he insisted that it wasn‚Äôt anything like that. I wasn‚Äôt able to get him to talk, so I went downstairs and tidied up the living room. It was then that I knocked his bookbag over, and, seeing that it was kind of a mess, decided to bring some sense order to it. Which is when I found the flyer. It turns out that his school (a small private Episcopal school) is having a parent/child dinner in a few weeks. Except that wasn‚Äôt what the flyer said ‚Äì ‚Äúparent‚Äù and ‚Äúchild‚Äù had been crossed out and replaced with something unrepeatable and ‚Äúcrackbaby.‚Äù On the back, in some badly-raised fourth grader‚Äôs handwriting, was a note that made some libelous and incredibly homophobic insinuations about Jonah‚Äôs relationship with my husband and me, along with equally libelous and homophobic insinuations about why we adopted him, all topping it off with a claim that if he went to the dinner with us this other child would call the police and make these accusations to them and Jonah would end up back in foster care. My husband and I told Jonah we knew about the flyer and coaxed the story out of him. After a lot of tears we were able to get the whole story and the culprit ‚Äì whose identity is no surprise; the ringleader's mother is a vindictive harridan of a woman who practically crooned whenever she informed me that Jonah had had a bad day when he was in first grade and she was a classroom volunteer. She would then talk about knowing how ‚Äúkids like him‚Äù are, and it took all of my self-control to not ask what she meant by ‚Äúkids like him‚Äù. It turns out that her son and a few other boys have made Jonah‚Äôs misery their own special project, and this has been going on since school started. We have a meeting with the principal on Friday. My husband insisted on going with me because he's worried I'm going to bite someone's head off.

771,My fiance wants me to keep my stepdad away from my kids.,"UPDATE I told my mother I didn't want her husband around my kids. It didn't go well. She disowned me, brought my siblings into it and blew up on them. Now half my family wont speak to me. Editing to add that yes, I understand fully that my fiance is correct. This has gotten a lot more traffic than I thought it would, so unless you've got advice on how to set those boundaries with family or have been through a similar situation, you can kindly stop beating a dead horse.* So here's the back story: my stepdad has been in my life since I was in the third grade (I'm not 30 years old). Once I hit adolescence he said some unethical things and overstepped a lot. He took my bedroom door away and wouldn't allow me to hang up a sheet for privacy. He went through my dirty clothes and threw away any underwear he thought I should t be wearing. He went through my underwear drawer and took my ""personal massager"". In addition to making little comments about my physical appearance. Even after I became an adult and left the house he still would make inappropriate comments to me. Finally since I started having kids he would stare at me while I was trying to latch my newborn onto my breast üôÑ. (Yes, my mom was present for everything and never said a word in my defence. I was deeply affected by all of this growing up and it's taken me a long time to get over it). I have since set a boundary with my stepdad about the way he speaks to me and he's respected it since then without any issues. My fiance hates my stepdad and doesn't want to allow him around our children. I do not want to set that boundary. I'm afraid if I do so I will lose my mother as well, which is a reasonable possibility in my family situation. We have argued about this a lot and I don't know what to do.

So I said okay, gave him the vacuum and took the tablet to watch him on our Nest camera while I got my work stuff together. He was vacuuming, vacuuming‚Ä¶ fine. Our Nest camera is in the corner by the door, so you can‚Äôt see the actual kitchen door on the camera. My husband had just left and hadn‚Äôt locked it on the way out. We usually keep our doors locked, but he had just forgotten that time and I didn‚Äôt double check it was locked.

I went downstairs to check‚Ä¶ And the kitchen door was WIDE OPEN. Baby GONE. I screamed and ran outside barefoot - didn‚Äôt see the baby. We live in a townhome and the door he got out of is about 10 feet from a busy parking lot. I ran up and down the sidewalk, screaming his name. My neighbor saw me running around barefoot and asked if I was okay. I said NO, my baby is gone, he opened the door! She pointed behind me and said ‚Äúisn‚Äôt that him?‚Äù He was running down the sidewalk towards me in his socks, happy as a clam. I‚Äôll add we still have some snow on the ground where I live, so it was far too cold for him to be outside in his normal clothes. Reviewing the footage, he opened the door (can see the shadow move on the video) at 15 minutes, 31 seconds past the hour. I came downstairs at 16 minutes, 22 seconds past the hour. In less than 60 seconds, he was out the door and out of sight (he had run around the side of the building which is why I didn‚Äôt see him immediately when I went outside). Baby is safe. Mama is traumatized. To think of all the terrible things that could‚Äôve happened is gut wrenching. We had no idea he could open doors, but of course that is no excuse. I should have checked the door was locked before I went upstairs. I should have known better. My son could be dead or kidnapped or seriously hurt because of my negligence.

But I've got to ask the parents of reddit: do us young parents complain too much? In general, I don't vent at all to mother-in-law.

As the mom of course I feel guilty that I don't play with our kids but at the same time I feel like he should be stepping up and helping with the household chores. We live with roommates so the only thing he has to do is drop the kids at daycare/school and take care of things around the house. He hasn't washed clothes or put them away unless I yell at him to do it, the bathroom hasn't been cleaned in months till I did it, and our son's room was a mess till I, with the help of the 6 year old, cleaned it up. I am at the end of my rope. He says I blame him for everything when I just try to make him have some responsibility. We've been married for 7 years and it seems that ever since we had the 2 year old he's checked out of the house and just wants to be the fun dad. Every time I try to bring something up that is upsetting me he turns it around and yells about how much of a bad parent I am.

Thanks all for the excellent suggestions on how to be prepared for the next time this comes up. This is really just a rant. My youngest just started daycare last week at 15 months.  My wife and I both work at home and balancing that with childcare has been really hard, so it‚Äôs been a huge relief. So this week he has the standard daycare sniffles that we completely expected having had his older brother (4) in the same daycare.  The place is clean, all the adults are vaccinated and masked, and our little guy is having the time of his life - but the little ones just sneeze into each other‚Äôs eyeballs and spread stuff around. Little guy needed his 15 month vaccinations, so I had an appointment this morning, and the Dr. very reasonably thought it was important to focus on his symptoms (which are - a little sleepy, a runny nose, and some diaper rash) just in case, and of course we need to do the ‚Äòwell I don‚Äôt think this is Covid but we need to do a swab just in case‚Äô test. And I get it, and I want my son to be healthy and I know the Drs office can‚Äôt use ‚Äòwell it‚Äôs probably not Covid‚Äô as enough to be safe, but you know I hadn‚Äôt really planned on having both kids home for the next 2 days while we wait for this test to come in.

Last night his dad commented about how ‚Äúbad‚Äù his cursing has gotten (he was in some heated battle online) and insinuated we needed to control it some how. I found this request confusing. First, dad curses regularly and we have not built a family value that cursing is overtly wrong, only that there are times and places it is absolutely inappropriate. And when our son was younger he didn‚Äôt curse at all, this is pretty new occurrence. Second, I asked his dad ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt you curse when your were his age?‚Äù; the nature of friendships has dramatically changed, many of his friends are solely online (pandemic has kept us home), and it seems normal to me for teens to experiment with this type of expression with their friends (I know I did, I just wasn‚Äôt at home). I told his dad that considering our son is in HIS room in HIS home and talking to HIS friends that the cursing isn‚Äôt a huge issue. His home and room are a safe place, his only safe place to really explore his identity and many of his friends exist online. 20 years ago it might be a different story, as it was for us, we‚Äôd be out of ear shot of our parents but still cursing.

It's never been something we've shielded from her. She was raised by myself and my best friend so we were always very open about periods and the things that came along with it. She started puberty within the last year so we've had more talks about what's to come and why it's happening lately but I was still a little shocked she started at 9. She was inconsolable but in a humorous way. She said she didn't want to do this until she was 50. Her body didn't tell her she was going to start. She was gonna pee tomato juice for a week. Lol I kept her home from school. Got her some pads and some ice cream  We're family friends with the school principal so we told her and she said she could always keep an extra outfit and underwear in her office in case anything happened. The nurse was informed as was her teacher. They all were very sweet offering to let her go to the nurse's bathroom instead of the kid's bathroom while she adjust. She went to school today and they said she went to the bathroom every hour to check. She came home and said everything went fine but wanted to know if there were different types of pads because she wasn't sure she liked the ones she had. I told her we could go look tomorrow night. We've given her a few tips that all girls use: asking your friends to check your pants, wrapping a sweater around your waist, keeping extras in pockets of backpacks...I think I have done all I really can. I know I was terrified at 13, knowing it was going to happen at any moment, and having friends who had already started. I couldn't imagine being 9, still a baby, not really fully understanding or having anyone your age to relate to. She's handling it well though.

809,"Teachers' complaints about ""today's"" kids and parents","I happen to follow some teaching-related subs and accounts on Instagram. I almost wanted to ask this question there but wasn't sure if I was allowed as I am not a teacher. So many teachers are leaving education. And the two biggest reasons I see are: Kids are more disrespectful than ever before Parents either don't care at all, or they refuse to hold their kids accountable Administration/bureaucracy is also a top complaint. But the first two seem the most common. A lot of these comments seem to be coming from teachers who have been in the field a long time, and who have watched the landscape change. It's really concerning as a parent of a young child to read about so many teachers leaving the field. I think education is a key foundation for setting up our kids for success in adulthood. I am not saying the U.S. public education system isn't flawed - it is. But we NEED good teachers for our kids. Most of us can't afford to quit our jobs and homeschool our children, nor can most people afford private school (which... still need teachers). Where is the breakdown happening? Where are we (parents), as a whole, falling short in raising respectful kids? I am curious to hear other parents' views on this, and especially those who are also teachers! Edited to Add: Thank you so much to everyone who has responded so far. This conversation has been enlightening and interesting and heartbreaking on so many levels. I thought it might be interesting/helpful to outline just some of the trends I am seeing in the responses up here, because when you start to see them like pieces of the puzzle, it's easier to see just how COMPLEX the issues really are: Teachers are not paid enough for the number of hours they work, and for the amount of BS they have to put up with. If most of their job was the actual teaching part, it sounds like it would be easier to swallow the low salary...but dealing with administration issues, paperwork, online learning, changing policies, etc. zaps away their energy for teaching. Parents and kids in denial are just icing on the cake. Social media and screen time in general - kids have shorter attention spans, are allowing peers and influencers to be their moral compass, and are treating school like an extension of their online social lives, rather than a place for learning. Parents are burned out. Like teachers, they are likely underpaid and overworked and can't focus on the things they should be focusing on at home because they don't have the time or energy. They look to the schools to fill gaps at home, but the teachers don't have the energy for that role either.",,False,False,parenting

Why are you so hell-bent on having my daughter stay the night with you? It's creepy behavior. I've always kept a close eye on my daughter and found his behavior a little odd sometimes. She also has older male cousins that would be there as well, which I'm not 100% comfortable with. When I was her age, I was molested by an older female cousin at a sleepover. So maybe that's why I'm extra cautious. Anyway, now I'm the ""mean"" parent and my daughter and in-laws are upset with me. Sorry for the rant! Anyone else go through this?",,False,False,parenting
811,"The power of saying ""me too""","OMG the phrase ""me too"" has been working wonders for us lately. When our kid asks for things that are totally not possible now we can just say ""me too"" and there's usually no argument! i.e: Kid: I want to go onto a boat! Dad: me too. Kid: me too. end! Previously we would try to explain why it couldn't happen and it would sometimes become a fight. Saying ""me too"" gives empathy and puts us on his side.

My parents live maybe 15 minutes away but don‚Äôt visit all too often. They seem to like to act like COVID is nothing but generally will use hand sanitizer when we ask.

My parents have not visited for about a month now because they had COVID about 3 weeks ago.

I very much agree with my wife that they should get the vaccine as we have both gotten it, but I simply don‚Äôt think we should tell them they have to or else. After I said that, my wife had told me, ‚Äúwell you aren‚Äôt putting our kids first.‚Äù And that definitely stung and I am torn. In the past at times, I have definitely have had a hard time agreeing with things like when my daughter stayed the night at my parents cabin and my parents wanted to take her on the boat. My wife did not want her on a boat under any circumstance and I was ok with it. My parents made me feel like it was so dumb not to allow them to so I tried to push my wife to be ok with it but looking back, I was basically ignoring her feelings. In the current case, I agree they should get the vaccine, but I just feel like an ultimatum is a little much. Edit: thank you for all the response so far.

But, we've discovered the cheat that allows us to get him to do anything! I'm sure it will wear off eventually, but it has yet to fail us. And so I have to share with you all in the hopes that it may also work with your toddlers. Give the toddler a choice, two options, both of which involve the thing you want to happen, but gives them something they are in control of. Don't want your nappy changed? Which teddy would you like to hold whilst your nappy is changed? Don't want a t-shirt on? Would you like the t-shirt with a digger or the t-shirt with a dinosaur on? Don't want to wash your hands for dinner? Would you like mummy to help wash your hands or daddy? Don't want to eat your vegetables? Do you want the peas first or carrots first?

When my son was born I brought back some clothes he was wearing the first day for her and my other dog (same breed) to get his scent so they don‚Äôt overwhelm him when they first meet. It went very well and besides a couple sniffs and licks on the feet the first meeting went very well. A couple days in I showed them both a dirty diaper and gave them the speech that it is not a toy or a treat and not to beg for them and such and gave them a treat afterward when they didn‚Äôt try to eat it. After that is where the surprising thing happened. Pennie got the wrong message, around 2am when my wife was sleeping she came up to me whining and frantic. So I got up and followed her thinking she needed to go out and instead she brought me right to his crib, where I found my son about to start crying and wake up. So I got him up and checked him and sure enough a full poopy diaper. I have never seen a dog so proud of herself. Of course she got a treat and lots of praise for it and has been doing this since.

My daughter on the other hand was so focused on each toy, she didn‚Äôt care to see what else she got. Today is Orthodox Christmas so we usually do a smaller celebration since my husband is Orthodox. I was so excited about buying two games on sale for the kids. They each were only getting one gift because of finances. I looked online before ordering and both games were supposed to be multi-player. Unfortunately only one was multiplayer, that was the first tantrum trigger because they didn‚Äôt want to take turns. My other son just said he wanted a different game next Christmas. Why do I even f***ing bother! There was so much crying and whining I just snapped and locked myself in my room to cry.

First, it's cold and rainy, so the park is out. But that's okay! Switch to rainy day mode! He's having leftover cake (from his dad's yesterday) for breakfast, and you should have seen his face, he was so excited! Next up is turning out the lights and settling in with some popcorn for an Avatar the Last Airbender (he loves it and I'm proud of his good taste lol) binge. Starting with episode 1 and going till he wants to stop! I'll be making a sneaky call to Build a Bear to make sure they have the pay your age birthday bear, and if so, off to the mall! If so then we'll stop by the small arcade after if they're open, and a trip to the candy shop (nice old fashioned place with scooping candy and the giant old fashioned rainbow lollipops in different shapes) to pick one or two special treats. Then science! If we skip the mall it just means more science! We'll be doing the carpet experiment, which is honestly ""mama really needs to hardcore clean that carpet"", but he's been wanting to do it with me. It's essentially a small scale baking soda volcano experiment; the carpet will start to fizz/crackle where you spray it. Followed by the coke n mentos experiment (hopefully it'll stop raining by then because it's going to be outside either way). Then paper ""blooming"" flowers, I'll write nice things inside. And, of course, slime! Thank you to the one who tipped me off about using lotion! Then baking cookies together and going to the grocery to either get the carrot cake or pick a box mix to make a cake. After dinner and cake we'll do presents, and then unlimited game time till he falls asleep (no school tomorrow, and so far he can't stay up past 10, so hopefully this won't come back to bite me lol).

828,I barred my grandmother from seeing my children,"Let me start off by saying that I never had the best relationship with my grandmother, but as a kid I saw her occasionally because my parents went to see her. My family is pretty religious, and I am one of few who don't feel anything with the strict religious attitude most in the family have. Even borderline atheist on my side. My grandmother doesnt like me because I became an escort while going to university to pay for it all and started dating a guy who had a tattoo (name of his sister, who had died). Every time I saw her (over 10 years ago) she would spend more time explaining writings from the bible than actually having a conversation. It's who she is, and I accept that. She's my grandmother regardless of how I feel about it, and I do believe she should be allowed to practice her religion. I just got more upset every time I had to listen to it, so I chose to not visit anymore. Despite this she tried to get back in contact. She said that she wanted to see my children sometimes too, and just because I was a ""bad person"" in my past, I could still become a ""good believer"". After some time we decided to just try it and let her visit. In my head, the worst that could happen was that the kids would say she is a weird grandma, and my philosophy is that one can't choose their family, so just love them as they are. Date was set, and she came over. I was incredibly uncomfortable but I went through with it. As she got in, she mentioned that she had gotten some gifts for her great-grandchildren. She immediately reached for some small gifts she got for the kids. Some dolls for my twin daughters, the youngest kids. Some legos for my son. And then my oldest daughter stood waiting, her autism and selective mutism not allowing her to ask or say anything. My grandma closed the bag instead. Straight up she said that there was no gift for her, because she was born out of wedlock. My daughter got visibly upset. While the shock sank in with me, my son just understood one thing. His big sister was not getting a gift. So he handed her his box of legos instead. Grandma pulled it straight out of her hands, and handed it back to him, saying that kids born out of wedlock do not deserve to get gifts. Meanwhile my son got the same angry (and to the younger me, pretty scary) preachings I got when I was younger. My husband overheard it all from the kitchen, I was just not believing it all and froze. He got up to her to thank her for her visit and say that she could leave the house by herself or he would help her leave (with a tone that made clear that he might toss her out of the window). After some time of argueing, she left. Now I got messages from both my grandmother and my mother saying how I limit their freedom of religion, how we have no right to prevent her from seeing my kids, because they are her family too, and how they will consider pressing legal charges because my husband ""dared to force her out of the house"" after we invited her over. Meanwhile my kids don't understand it all, and I don't know how to explain it well. I feel bad for ever agreeing to her coming to visit, hindsight 20/20 but I feel I should have known better. I am embarrased about it all. TLDR;  I barred my grandmother from seeing my children because of her religious views, though she says that in barring her from that, I limit her religious freedom. I should have known better than to allow her to visit at all.",,False,False,parenting

836,Please don‚Äôt ask me if my baby is my own,"I have two kids - a 2.5 year old boy and a 3 month old baby girl. I had so many complications during my pregnancy and we are so blessed to have our baby girl alive and healthy. Our little girl was born 9 weeks early and was sick with sepsis and meningitis - I ended up becoming septic as well with the same bacteria she has. It was scary and traumatic. She had a 50/50 chance of survival and we are so lucky she pulled through and is now thriving and home from the NICU. I‚Äôm in therapy, but the pregnancy and NICU experience were really challenging for me mentally. When I get really stressed I can‚Äôt eat, so I‚Äôve lost all of the baby weight plus more (I was a healthy weight when I got pregnant). Running is also a stress reliever for me so the weight has just melted off between not eating much and running a lot. I‚Äôve had similar situations a handful of times, and it just really bothers me. Today we took our kids to pick pumpkins. A lady approached me as I was holding my daughter and asked if she is my baby. I said yes. She then asked if she was my biological child, I said yes. Then she asked if I even gained any weight during my pregnancy. I said yes. And then she told me  I don‚Äôt look like I had a baby. The whole conversation was uncomfortable for me.

837,Going on vacation without kids and husband for a week?,I have the opportunity to go on vacation abroad (5 hour flight) with my mother and brother at the end of February.

839,My Newborn Still Doesn't Have a Name,"This is sort of a last ditch effort here. I couldn't make the post on my usual/old account because, for some reason, I can't make posts, comment or join any subreddits. I also know there is a dedicated subreddit for names, but you have to be subbed for x amount of days to post and I'm desperate. Also, I'm not looking for opinions on the names. My little girl is five days old and we still can't agree on a name. I'm exhausted as it as, and this argument over her name is even more exhausting. I'm upset because she doesn't have a name/didn't have a name when she was born. I hate having to call her ""the baby"", and the fact that we can't introduce her to people as her name. It breaks my heart. It's been a constant argument throughout my pregnancy between us; we couldn't agree on a name and it was just miserable. Everything since finding out the gender was miserable for me because it was nothing but an argument. It got to the point that I was very close to leaving. I have loved the name Orla (other spellings: Orlaith, Orlagh) for years and have always wanted to name my future child that. I've had my heart set on that name for so many reasons, but the most important being that I'm Irish and wanted something that was reminiscent of our heritage for her, especially if she wasn't going to have my Irish last name. Boyfriend veto'd the name the second that I suggested it and refused to even consider it. This has really upset me and I don't think it's fair at all. I come from a big family so a lot of traditional Irish names (especially ones that aren't too misleading with their spellings) have been used by various close family members on both my mum and dad's sides so are off limits. Think along the lines of Maeve, Roisin, Saoirse, Aoife, Mairead, Niamh, Aisling, Laoise, Shannon, Sinead, Siobhan, Clara, etc. Along with the typical ""common"" names such as Elisabeth, Mary, Ann, Marie, Catherine, Kathleen, Grace, Sophia, Charlotte, etc. I already agreed to give up the tradition that goes back God knows how many generations in my family in which the girls have the middle names Mary Ann (also mine) because he said it would make her sound like an old lady. I'm not exactly fond of these middle names either and was okay giving them up for our daughter, all i asked for was the name Orla; he won't even consider it being her middle name. It's just no after no. His options have all come from a name book, with no meaning or importance behind them and are all top 100 names... probably top 20. His choices are Olivia, Amelia, and Jessica. I veto'd them, but apparently since I veto'd them, it doesn't matter and they're all still ""our top choices"" as he tells his mother. Apart from not liking them, and wanting something Irish for my daughter, I don't want something that's so popular. She's going to be one of multiple in all of her classes. I was told, by his mother, that I had to compromise with him. Even though he doesn't have to compromise. So I offered him some compromises; Orla is her first name and he got to choose the middle name with his last name, or her name isn't Orla/her middle name is Orla but she has my last name. None of these options suited him (or his mother) and he just says no to all of them. So now we're at a stale mate once again, except this time... she's actually here and we're on a deadline to picking a name before registration. Not to mention, I am mortified at having to introduce her to people as ""the baby"". Honestly, just not sure what to do at this point. Still very close to leaving him. Also very close to just going to register her on my own, without him, and naming her myself because I just want her to have a name. I feel terrible that she doesn't have a name already.",,False,False,parenting
840,College is almost over and I don't want to pay anymore,"My daughter (21) is smart, lovely, -- and supremely self-centered. She only contacts us when she needs something; when we ask something from her (like assurance that she will take her car to get an oil change or that she's alive), we hear nothing back. Example: She recently moved into her last college apt and urgently asked how checks work (for paying rent; this new landlord doesn't accept automatic bill-pay). I immediately replied and explained that she needs to call the bank and ask for checks. I also asked her to send me the receipt for a pair of eyeglasses she charged on her dad's credit card (I need the receipt for reimbursement). All she had to do is scan the receipt with her phone and email or text it to me; a two minute task at most. As always, it's been days and I didn't receive the scanned bill. The reason for her silence? In the same conversation, I also asked whether she has seen her academic advisor and registered on her college's job search platform. Those questions shut her down, as the answers apparently were ""no"" and she doesn't want to deal with the ""hassle"" of being responsible and proactive. I plan to cut her off financially the moment she graduates. She's not searching for a job, is not finishing COVID-caused incompletes, is only taking 12 credit hours (but has no part-time job), has ""missed"" the opportunity to look for internships, and immediately spends every penny she gets from us. She receives: $1,200 for rent (which is $480) and living expenses; a 2-year-old car (that she has banged up and trashed); health insurance; a brand-new iPhone with a plan; car insurance (she just caused $3,000 of damage to the car by driving too fast over a speed bump); tuition. She has her father's credit card for books and medical plus emergencies. Because she has a younger brother, she will be on the family health insurance until age 24. Other than that, I don't want to give her any more money. She has been told several times to start looking for a job in her field and to save some of the money she gets. In one ear and out the other.... Am I being too harsh? I keep thinking that only a cold-turkey stoppage of the cash flow will teach her to become self-sufficient. Supporting her while she's not being responsible seems like coddling her beyond her age and enabling her irresponsibility. I need to add that I was completely on my own -- without another penny ever from my parents -- at 17.5. So I'm not sure whether I'm approaching this from the right angle. My husband wants to protect his little girl from the harshness of this world, but I manage all our financial decisions, so I am ultimately in charge of the money spigot. Thanks in advance for advice. Edit: I should have pointed out that I told her three years ago already and repeated many times that she will no longer get financial support when she graduates. She has been put on ample notice and was advised to save her generous allowance to cushion the transition into adult life. She chooses not to heed this warning and spends her money as soon as it arrives. Yes, we told her that she could stay at home if she hasn't found a job at graduation, but she isn't even making any steps toward setting up a career. She's a senior and (apart from a very short internship) has not approached a professor for a letter of recommendation, never seen her academic advisor, or entered her resume into the college's job search platform. Instead, she claims she is mentally ill (but won't see a therapist) and avoids contact with us the moment we point out the ill-advised behaviors she engages in.",,False,False,parenting

We had to wait until Monday for the doctor to see her.  She had an ear infection.   Thus her infection went untreated for two days because of selfish pieces of shit who 'did their own research' while dropping a deuce at home.  I hate these people.  They should be sent to the parking lot and have to wait until we have the capacity to treat them.  They should not get priority treatment.  Fuck em.  If you're unvaxxed by choice, you are the real virus in society. Today, we find out on Tuesday some parent sent their kid to daycare (in my sons classroom) with a fever and cold symptoms.  He was in the classroom half the day before sent home.  That boy tested positive for COVID yesterday.  Awesome.  So we will get our boy tested.  Nope, this is America and our testing sucks.  Nothing available until after Christmas.  Fine, buy an at home test, nope this is America, they are impossible to find.   Ugh. I really hate people right now.

The response I got was that she was mad that I painted his nail and continued to tell me that I have to tell him that nail polish is just for girls. So I told her nail Polish doesn't have a gender there's tons of guys that have worn polish before (alt, punk, etc.) and still do to this day.

I also cry almost every day because I love him so much. I literally didn't know it was possible to love someone so much. I love my husband with all my heart and consider him my soulmate, but this love for my baby is something else. It's overwhelming. The first time he opened his eyes, it was like the sun came out. I live for those moments now, when his eyes are open and he's staring, wide-eyed at the world. Nothing else exists when that happens. It's like he has his own field of gravity. My parents weren't nurturing are all. You could make a good case for neglect or even a bit worse. I'm 40. I've worked on myself for decades. I'm happy and confident with who I've become. And now this little 7lb guy is changing every single thing about me. I feel like I'm down the rabbit hole. And it feels like home.",,False,False,parenting

865,Am I over reacting to the grooming vibes I got from my child's dance studio?,"Forgive the length. TLDR at bottom. My daughter (3.5) just started a weekly dance studio thing after preschool. Once a week, we put her in her tutu/leggings(which took me about 10 minutes because I am inept when it come to girl clothes) and we drop her off at a dance studio after preschool. This place has been around even when I was a kid. I'm pretty sure it's just an excuse to dress up like a ballerina so the moms can fawn over their darlings but that's besides the point. I'm not sure if it is a covid protocol, or if there just isn't room for 20 extra bodies, but it's a no parents allowed sort of thing. Today was her second session, and everything seemed to be fine. She came home happy and seemed to love her dancing hour. As I'm getting ready for dinner, she is just blabbing a bit and mentions a secret that her teacher told her. My ears kind of perked up and I pressed her a bit about the secret. The more I ask, the more odd it sounds. When I ask directly (but not firmly, trying to play like I'm not even a bit worried) what the secret is, she says something to the effect of ""but Mrs. X said I can't tell anyone, even mommy or daddy"". At this point the worst is already running through my head and worse yet, my kid is NOT telling me the secret. She even gets panicked when I say we are going to call Mrs. X and starts crying. Wife calls the studio, and gets some odd little answer about a pretend game they are playing with the kids that sounds believable enough. A bit later when things calmed down I reminded her how long it took to get her leggings on, just discreetly prodding for more information. I asked her if her leggings had come off since we put them on and she said no and I have no reason to think that isn't true. There was no distress or hint of bullshit in her answer. In the end, I dont really think that any funny business went on. I just think that her instructor told her something she really shouldn't have and it really had me worried. A few hours after class, there was a group message about the secret, mentioning its trivialness. Maybe its just me, but having another adult tell my child ""you cant even tell mom or dad"" reaaaaaally rubs me the wrong way. TLDR: Adult told my 3 y/o to keep a secret from her parents and it made me think the worst. Am I an overworried parent, or would this have bothered you too?",,False,False,parenting

She started dating a boy 2 years ago and honestly it was cute at first. We allowed him over, pics at school dances, met the parents, etc... About a year ago I started seeing small clues of his verbal abuse, calling her worthless at school in front of friends, if she didn't answer her phone, he would call my other kids asking where the f#ck she was. About 6 months ago she randomly quit her job and didn't want to be around friends or family.  Around the same time he was draining her bank account I keep track of. $200 here, $100 there, $70 for postmates to his house, the list goes on. Then, he cheated on her twice.  We spoke to her about getting a job again, and she agreed. She got a job after 2 interviews and a drug test, started  last week. This week the manager called and said she never showed up to work ever..... despite her telling me she was going to work. She was with him all 4 times (checked her bank account that is now drained to $1). I have told her no more money from me, and no more car until she can respect herself and our rules. How do I stop her co-dependant behavior and help her see he is such a negative influence on her? Any suggestions please! I am at a loss. :(  UPDATE!!! since yesterday I got such amazing advice from everyone I was really overwhelmed. I sent her a link to an online ""Am i in an abusive relationship"" quiz.  I didn't tell her to take it or push it just left it in the text. After I asked if therapy would be good to help with her struggling with moods/ lying (didn't mention the boyfriend) and she agreed to do it!! I called her school counselor this morning and just got off the conference call with the assistant principal and her counselor for her grade. Turns out they already kind of knew about the situation but not in detail or the extent. :( But we have all made a plan to support her and let her know there is a safe spot and several people she can confide in if she wants to. I asked her counselor to keep it confidential if she does talk, and she doesn't need to mention I am the one who called in, to keep my home and myself a safe spot as well.

No one prepared me adequately for parenthood. Edit to add: I see that there are a lot of different opinions on how this could have been handled. I grew up very sheltered then had to fend for myself at 18. I'm firmly of the opinion that kids will learn about the world one way or another, so me choice is whether or not I want to help guide and add some reason and question in the mix. I try to treat my kids as an age appropriate version of an adult. It might be controversial, but they're going to be adults one day.

But then he added that in return he will take a shift on baby duty afterwards so I can sort LO's bath out. It really touched a nerve because it feels like I am accommodating his downtime, and he thinks a fair return is that he will keep LO occupied while I sort out household chores.

And so yesterday we all took a trip to our community park. We figured he could talk to some kids. He was pretty nervous but he did it. He went up to a girl and asked if she wanted to play. Girl said yes, and so they played. I could tell he was still nervous, but he was there keeping up with conversation, and talking about games with her. I could tell the girl was getting bored and a little uninterested. Before leaving she asked if he would be back at the park the next day and he said yes. On our way back home he was so proud. He told me himself that he was so proud of himself, and couldn't believe he had made a friend. Fast forward to today, he woke up excited for his playdate. All day asking ""what time is it?"".

My son starts getting ignored, but he still tries to talk to her and her friend. Our community has two small parks that are walking distance and so the two girls walked towards the second park, and my son asked me and his dad if we could all go. So we did, and as he was trying to play with them he gets told by friend #2 that he can't play with friend #1 because her dad doesn't let her play with boys. My son was so heartbroken that he cried.

He had a really strange night of sleep the night before, so when I woke him up to get him ready for school, I wasn‚Äôt surprised that he was a little groggy. He got ready for school, ate breakfast, and seemed mostly himself, other than a runny nose. Here it is important to note that I am a teacher at his preschool, but not in his class. I have very little contact with him throughout the day. So the last two days, his regular teacher has been out. When I dropped him off at his classroom in the morning, I let the teacher who was filling in know about his weird sleep and that he was a little groggy. On my lunch, the teacher told me he was having a good day, but that he was currently napping. My son will nap sometimes, but rarely is it voluntary, so that seemed odd. A little while later, I was getting ready to get him and take him to his scheduled appointment when I was called in my classroom. My son woke up with a fever. I joked with my coteacher that it was a good thing he was going to the doctor. On our way, I called them and let them know the situation and they said it was ok to bring him in, but he obviously would not be seen for any vaccinations. No big deal. Once we were at the doctors and waiting for him to be seen in the room, my work called me. I was given the worst news I could imagine.

Literally a week later it was postponed. Now daughter dies not want to wear the dress. When I say doesn't, I mean full on panic attack and more upset than I have ever seen her.

One of the leaders is a girl who has been giving her shit since they started school together at 5 years old.  My caught is loud, empathetic,  stands up for injustice and comes across as very sure of herself.     She is also very musically and athletically talented, other things for these girls to get jealous of.   16 yrar old me would have been in awe of her and adults cannot understand why she is bullied but she is,  and has been all her life.

She was so stressed,  well exhausted for all the emotion, she had some time off school yesterday.  She tried both outfits,  thought about it rationally,  mulled over what I had said to her,  and has decided on the dress (although she had until 4pm this afternoon to lock  that in because depending on the outfit she needs body tape or hem adjustment) She even did her face tan (and a very good job of it) so I do think the dress is a goer.",,False,False,parenting
911,TIL Gun Safety Rules apply terribly well to Changing Diapers.,"At my place it's in the middle of the night when I got up to change the diaper of my daughter of four weeks. It ended up to be a diaper change with a lot of collateral damage. That's when it struck me and pulled me right out of my sleep-deprived state: take the common gun safety rules, and adapt/apply them to babies and you will be at least a bit safer. Just replace the word gun with baby: Treat all babies as if they are loaded. Always assume that a baby is loaded even if you think it is unloaded. Every time a baby is handled for any reason, check to see that it is unloaded. If you are unable to check a baby to see if it is unloaded, leave it alone and seek help from someone more knowledgeable about babies. Keep the baby pointed in the safest possible direction. Always be aware of where a baby is pointing. A ""safe direction"" is one where an accidental discharge of the baby will not cause injury or damage. Only point a baby at an object you intend to shoot. Never point a baby toward yourself or another person. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot. Always keep your finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot. Even though it may be comfortable to rest your finger on the trigger, it also is unsafe. If you are moving around with your finger on the trigger and stumble or fall, you could inadvertently pull the trigger. Sudden loud noises or movements can result in an accidental discharge because there is a natural tendency to tighten the muscles when startled. The trigger is for firing and the handle is for handling. Know your target, its surroundings and beyond. Check that the areas in front of and behind your target are safe before shooting. Be aware that if the bullet misses or completely passes through the target, it could strike a person or object. Identify the target and make sure it is what you intend to shoot. If you are in doubt, DON'T SHOOT! Never fire at a target that is only a movement, color, sound or unidentifiable shape. Be aware of all the people around you before you shoot. Know how to properly operate your baby. It is important to become thoroughly familiar with your baby. You should know its mechanical characteristics including how to properly load, unload and clear a malfunction from your baby. Obviously, not all babies are mechanically the same. Never assume that what applies to one make or model is exactly applicable to another. You should direct questions regarding the operation of your baby to your firearms dealer, or contact the manufacturer directly. Store your baby safely and securely to prevent unauthorized use. Babies and ammunition should be stored separately. In addition to these basic rules there are some things, that have to be kept in mind as well when handling guns/babies: a) Never handle a baby when you are in an emotional state such as anger or depression. Your judgment may be impaired. b) Hand your baby to someone only after you verify that it is unloaded and the cylinder or action is open. Take a baby from someone only after you verify that it is unloaded and the cylinder or action is open.",,False,False,parenting
912,Parenting and Cannabis,"Had an interesting parenting moment the other night. The wife and I took edibles shortly before the kids (2M & 5F) went to bed.

Seeing things from their perspective and truly wanting to help them. Not just doing the steps I have to do in order to have mom and dad time. I fell in love with my kids all over again.

913,Firearm incident at Cubscouts,"My (38f) son (6m) recently joined Cubscouts. He has been asking to join for years since my daughter (8f) joined girlscouts in kindergarten. My husband has been attending the entirety of all meetings, all scouts are required to have a parent attend. Yesterday, they got together at the den leader's home to go sledding and have a campfire. The den leader has 5 kids, the youngest of which is my son's age. She is also the pack master for the town and all her kids are in scouts. Near the very end of the meeting, one of the other kids that lived there (7f?) went inside where he dad and older siblings were and came out with a loaded firearm to show to all the kids. She was asking for more ammo according to my son. The parents were by the camp fire, the gun was brought out of the house at the bottom of the sledding hill, just around the corner of the house where the parents didn't have a direct line of sight, but maybe 50 ft away. My husband didn't realize that there was a gun until they were leaving, and assumed it was a toy. Our son told him otherwise. It kind of broke my husband's brain and he didn't know what to do about it. I was told this morning. I plan to pull my son from scouts, he will not go on that property again. Even if they replace the den leader, the homeowner/gunowner is still in charge of the pack as packmaster. I'm trying to decide if there's any other actions I should take. I have no issue with firearms, I was raised with them and my dad owns a gun shop. But leaving a loaded firearm where children can access it unsupervised is absolutely unacceptable and the incident could have ended much worse. The den leader noticed what was going on as everyone was leaving and was starting to address it with her kids, but has not communicated with us yet. What would you do next? Update: I called the local council after getting the first few replies on this thread, I appreciate the direction provided on how to do this. I left a message for the council CEO who is out of state right now, but he still called me back within 2 hours of my message. He asked for details, assured me it would be addressed, and asked us to email a written statement. I was called by another council leader today who had some additional questions, mainly a clearer timeline and additional names of who was there. He said that he had already notified the national council and needed these details to submit the rest of the incident report. He would also be contacting the local police and child protective services. My son is still deciding if he wants to continue in scouts after this.",,False,False,parenting

915,I cannot BELIEVE how much is assumed in kids birthday party politics,"My daughter wanted to have her 10th bday party at a local water park, its not much of a water park, one big water slide, a splash pad area and a big pool with a restaurant and a bar.  Its $15 entry for every head.  I gave my daughter a bunch of cheap invites filled out with the name of the park and a time and I wrote a note ""food and drink provided"" cause I'm gonna buy a bunch of pizzas there. Man, my wife was not happy about that.  So I posed for some answers on Facebook and apparently its pretty widely assumed you are supposed to pay for all these people's entry to a park if inviting them out.  If 20 kids decide to come with parents and siblings, that would be outrageous! Someone else mentioned kids getting dropped off, WHAT? I'm not offering to watch someones kid for free, I don't even know these people! I've been a dad for ten years and can't believe I haven't run into all this that seems to be assumed by so many. edit: Apparently I'm an idiot, the only two parties I've taken my kid to at an event place was a bowling party and a trampline party and we paid for both of those ourselves, was not covered by host.

916,I don't want to be a chef/baker/nutritionist/pediatrician/etc.,"My kid just turned 2. Last night, after a full day of work and toddler gymnastics class (which I found and signed up for), my husband and I were tired so when the kid asked for TV we were like ""sure, fine, great"". I gave him a plate of bananas, peas, and goldfish because it was my night to make dinner, but I didn't have the energy. He only ate the goldfish crackers. Now I've been awake since 3am researching vegetable powder to sneak veggies into pancakes and art projects that are easy to set up so we have a go-to activity when we're tired instead of TV because my brain is guilt-tripping me. Ever since he was born, I've been the main parent to plan activities, bake zucchini carrot bread, make baby-safe homemade paint, research hand/foot/mouth disease when a rash appeared on the kid's chin (which the doctor dismissed when I brought it up, but I was totally right), look up new recipes to try to get the kid to eat something other than goldfish, built a wooden activity board to develop fine motor skills, meal prep so us parents can eat something other than goldfish, find the family-friendly places around town (and make reservations because COVID restricts how many ppl can be there at once), sign up for library cards (and consequentially return the books on time). I've had to learn carpentry, baking (which I suck at), child psychology, toddler nutrition, child social/academic development, marriage counseling after children, cardboard engineering, even how to deal with invasive extended family (you know, the ones who raised 4 kids while immigrating to another country so nothing you do will ever be good enough). I'm also 7 months pregnant, so I've had to research home remedies for nausea, healthy alternatives to ice-cream, how to alleviate constipation, schedule blood tests and ob appts, and what the hell causes sciatica? Plus, I recently started a new job, so all the learning that comes with that. It feels like I've taken on several careers; don't we have a society with division of labor so we don't have to do everything ourselves??? All these parenting blogs and books give you are chores (how to make this at home! how to build this for your kid!). There are a bunch of electronic toys, but oh no, electronics are not good for development! There are premade snacks, but those are full of pReSErVatIvEs! Classes, nannies, playdates all turn you into a secretary/chauffeur/hiring manager. I'm trying not to resent my husband, he really is a great father, but jesus christ I wish he would make oatmeal peanut butter balls for me and the kid or set up weekend plans for all of us or add ingredients to the grocery list for a fun toddler activity he found online. I'm grateful the lawn gets mowed and the trash taken out, but it's hard not to feel resentment when I'm the one who can't sleep because if I do the kid's going to spend another night watching TV and eating goldfish. And then another. And another. I just want a box to show up on my doorstep every week with vegetable-packed toddler-approved snacks, toddler-safe/non-electronic activity supplies, a weekend schedule with pre-bought tickets, and a note card with instructions on one-side and a positive compliment that I'm an awesome parent on the other.

Hi there,so we are in the middle of a crisis. Me and my husband (37M,39M) are MDs. I am in PICU and my husband is an oncologist and we have to adopt our 14 year old nephew and he will come to our home next week.He lost his dad 2 weeks ago due to bile duct cancer,my sister(a.k.a his egg donor,she gave away her rights after she gave birth) is in jail due to multiple reasons and she won't be coming out soon,my parents are really old(they are 81 and 83),his dad's parents are dead and as a result, we are the ones that will adopt him and we don't know anything about raising teenagers other than they will be moody and they are very insecure about their bodies.

925,Meltdown,"I had a meltdown last night after shopping with my 5 year old son. He wanted a pink pencil case. There is absolutely nothing wrong with him wanting a pink pencil case. There is no sexuality attached to it in his mind one way or another. He‚Äôs just a little kid. I know from taking child development & working with kids that kids like what they like until adults tell them ‚Äúthat‚Äôs for boys‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs for girls‚Äù and then they tell each other these things & reaffirm it. But the reason for the meltdown was because I could imagine the conversations from well intended & (not so well intended) adults. I‚Äôm EXHAUSTED from the collective trauma that was unleashed by neighbors, family & in the media during an already traumatic time for everyone in the pandemic. I have tried my best to be compassionate & validate the feelings of others to no avail. Everyone else‚Äôs politically extreme opinions are floating around and haunting me constantly. Their extreme ultimatums for non-compliant perspectives seems to be burning rather than building bridges of understanding. It just feels like no one wants to listen and yet everyone wants to share their opinions & be seen, while attacking other people for wanting the same connection. I'm terrified about going back out into the world and accidentally activating someone else‚Äôs trauma. I already have a counseling appointment set up. I can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôm about to send my son into the world and I needed to tell someone how I feel so that I‚Äôm not irritable all day & maybe to reach out & know I‚Äôm not alone. Thanks.

First of all, I would like to say that he is a foster child, when he came to live with us he was already on probation and in active addiction.  We got him into rehab and have been dealing with him as an addict because his parents kicked him out.    We treat him as if he were our own and I don‚Äôt feel the need to label him as a foster.  So for everyone that judged me as a parent for having a son that is an addict and on probation/ankle monitor maybe you shouldn‚Äôt judge a person like that.  I took the girls to a meet up spot where they were picked up by their older sister.  They have good homes to go to, they wanted to hang out with my son.   We talked with him today and explained that our only knowledge of these girls is related to drugs and if he wants to hang out with them and allow us to get to know them in a different light then fine but that we will not allow kids who are known to be doing drugs in our home.   I do appreciate the sincere responses and helping me look at the real issue that they were potentially bringing drugs in our home and it‚Äôs not about gender.  Gave me a lot to think about today! Our son texted me at 11:40 tonight and said he needed a huge favor and that his two friends (one is an ex gf and one is his current gf) had no where to go tonight and needed a place to stay.  We said no, we don‚Äôt know them other than the few snaps we have seen -all which were drug related.  We said that we would be happy to get to know them during the day sometime.  He told them they could come anyways. The girls show up, I told them they could t spend the night but I would gladly drive them to their homes so they had a place to go.  I did drive them to a store where they were picked up by an older sister. Our son is so mad, like madder than we have ever seen him.  For some context, he has only been home from rehab for a couple of weeks, he is on an ankle monitor due to some legal problems and he isn‚Äôt attending school since he came home.  We are working on getting him scheduled for a GED class.  Anyways, his only social interactions are us and work right now.  I get that he wanted to hang out with friend.  I‚Äôm upset because he clearly disrespected us saying no and told them to come anyways.  He kept saying it‚Äôs just one time and he‚Äôs almost 18 so what‚Äôs the big deal. We grew up that sleepovers of the opposite sex did not happen, even if they slept in a separate room.  Are we out of touch with the ways things are now?  No matter what I am super frustrated that even after we said no he tried anyways and completely disregarded what we said.

Then comes time to get her dressed. He ‚Äòforgot‚Äô where our daughters pajamas are and he demanded I get them and bring them to him. Her pajamas are in the exact spot where they‚Äôve always been and he‚Äôs gotten them before. There‚Äôs no way he could‚Äôve just ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô where they were. I finally got my shower done and I come down to our room and see it‚Äôs a complete mess. My yarn is unraveled and knotted everywhere- the yarn i‚Äôd JUST rolled into a ball so I could crochet and had put it away- there‚Äôs toys thrown everywhere and our bed has no sheets on it at all. My fianc√© ‚Äòdoesn‚Äôt know how‚Äô to put sheets on our bed so if I don‚Äôt fight with it to put them on we‚Äôll just be sleeping on a bare mattress tonight. (Im still nursing a broken thumb that HE broke last week mind you. I can‚Äôt easily put sheets on) I know parenting doesn‚Äôt stop just because you‚Äôre sick or disabled but I just wanted a LITTLE help. I don‚Äôt have the energy to pick up our room or make the bed up. And I damn sure don‚Äôt have the energy to care for a two year old and a 31 year old toddler. I just don‚Äôt understand how he couldn‚Äôt just let me take a shower. Or to even just take the yarn away from our daughter. I don‚Äôt expect him to roll it back up but at least take it off the floor before he sprays the floor with harsh chemicals because he got poop on it. That‚Äôs the bare minimum. Especially when he knows how expensive the yarn I have is. It‚Äôs just so frustrating. I feel like I‚Äôm a single parent even though I‚Äôm in a relationship with my child‚Äôs father still.

This is making me feel so much better :) you‚Äôd think me having a very positive experience with having a sibling would be enough but now I gotta look through it from the other side haha!

941,Homework For Kindergarten,"I was just wondering if everyone's kids had homework every day in kindergarten. I don't really have an issue with homework, however I don't understand why my 6 year old needs it every day on top of 7 hours of school. And it's worksheets and sentences, etc, on top of whatever he didn't finish in class. Not just light reading or whatever. Some family members with kids a little older than our son have said it's insane. He's my first and only child, so I don't really know the drill.

942,"Let a fussy kid ""stay up late"" on the rule that they're only allowed to read in bed.","""Bed Time"" and ""Sleep"" don't always have to happen at the same time for kids - just like it often doesn't for us adults. I put my daughter to bed at 8pm but let her read in relatively low light in her room until she feels tired. She's usually knocked out by 9pm anyway (which still gives her nearly 10hrs of sleep), and she's learning new information and getting better at reading and spelling in the process. Plus it seems it feels like an extra privilege for her so she's always stoked when I ""allow"" it. That's three or four birds stoned at once, AND she's happy to do it? I feel like I unlocked a parenting cheat code. Try it yourself and let me know how it works.

I would love to respond to each of you, but with stress and exhaustion I‚Äôm not certain I‚Äôll get to everyone, but please know I‚Äôm so grateful! So a little clarification since exhausted me sounded like my husband was non existent in this. He has been here through all of this and has been incredible. He is my partner in everything. When I was afraid to talk to him it was because he asked if I was okay and I couldn‚Äôt respond. I just couldn‚Äôt talk and I didn‚Äôt want to think about anything anymore so I just shut off my brain. We have since discussed our fears and plans and are doing better. We do have an owlet as of last week and it‚Äôs been awesome and a godsend. Pretty much the only thing that kept me from panicking even more so last night. Lastly, my amazing doc fit us in and she was shocked that the PICU hadn‚Äôt given her reflux meds when she was released from the hospital. For some reason they had said that it wasn‚Äôt effective for newborns, but doc said that was bull haha. Which makes sense because it worked great for our eldest (her reflux manifested differently). So my honey is getting her meds now (some strong stuff!) and she told us to keep her upright for even longer after feedings. She strongly things that these episodes will improve and maybe even stop within two weeks! And then maybe she can get off her oxygen soon after. We are feeling much much more hopeful and comforted. Again, thank you so so much everyone! You guys helped so much! I‚Äôm scared to sleep tonight. It‚Äôs almost 4 am and I still have hardly slept. Paramedics have come and gone again. My preemie is doing so well, but keeps choking severely on her spit up. Once again I had to quickly flip her and suction her nose and mouth and pray her breathing would normalize and that the paramedics would get here quickly. I‚Äôm not looking for advice because we already have a plan, and I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm hoping to get from posting‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just scared. Scared I won‚Äôt hear her if she chokes. Scared to sleep and let my imagination run wild. Scared to talk to my husband about it because then it feels even more terrifying and real. Scared to think at all really‚Ä¶please just give your little ones a hug tonight, ok?",,False,False,parenting
944,A new mom friend came over to my house and insinuated my 4yo son might molest her daughter,"Am I right to be offended? A new mom friend I made that seemed super cool and had a 4 year old daughter came over today to hangout and play with my 4 year old son and go swimming. It was a mostly normal day until the end. We seemed to be hitting it off well. We are sitting there together actively watching the children play, and she suddenly freaks out when my son asked her daughter to go under the blankets with him on his bed. (My son is Autistic and has a thing with enclosing spaces and invites his friends into his tents/blankets/cabinets all the time.) She states that she has a rule that her daughter can‚Äôt be on a bed with a boy. If that‚Äôs her boundary as a parent, I totally respect it even if I think it‚Äôs personally silly. But then the kids get back on the bed again 10 minutes later and my friend yells at my son (?!?!?!) and then comes back to me all flustered and starts rambling about how ‚Äúhe just won‚Äôt stop trying to get her in bed with him‚Äù heavily insinuating there was some sort of ulterior motive in my son‚Äôs actions. I responded ‚Äúhe‚Äôs 4?‚Äù and just kind of stared at her shocked that she yelled at my son. She starts rambling again about how ‚Äúyou never know‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs not appropriate‚Äù and I just got really really uncomfortable and ended the play date really quickly. I think my friend picked up on my discomfort and she texted me apologizing for ‚Äúending things so intensely, are you ok?‚Äù and I just don‚Äôt even know how to respond right now. I was molested as a young girl and had fairly strict rules regarding sleepovers and boys, so I understand the reasoning behind it. And I sensed that maybe there‚Äôs some history there that‚Äôs influencing her reaction and I don‚Äôt want to invalidate that possibility.

945,My Daughter Isn‚Äôt Difficult,"My husband is not a people person. He is brash, abrasive, independent, curt, ambitious, and stubborn. And I love him whole heartedly.

Fast forward to present day, and we have two beautiful daughters: a 4 month old quiet cuddled, and a 21 month old balls to the wall explorer!  My family keeps making comments about me ‚Äúhaving my hands full‚Äù or her being really independent, but every now and then they slip in what they really mean and call her difficult. I don‚Äôt really limit her. I want her to test her limits on her own terms, but I have clearly expressed boundaries and she mostly respects them. (She is a toddler so there are occasional tantrums, well within normal toddler shit.) Difficult for who? Not me. I love her personality. Difficult why? She didn‚Äôt want to hug you or hold you hand or wanted to play independently? She expresses what she wants and doesn‚Äôt want clearly? She enforces her boundaries? She likes a schedule? I think the truth is she has a strong personality. It sucks that she‚Äôs being labeled so young for things that I think are great. She‚Äôs strong and feisty and perfect.  I have a niece forging her own path who is 3 and I hear similar things. I don‚Äôt want it to be gendered but I have never heard these comments about boys the same age. Fuck that.

946,I told my husband I didn't want anymore children,"So my husband (31) and I (25) have a daughter turning 3 this December, and our plan has always been to have 3-4 children. I cut that number down to two after our daughter was an infant and I imagined going through the newborn phase with lots of other people to take care of. Recently though I've been realizing that I don't think I can personally handle caring for more little ones while also making sure to finally learn how to care for myself. Last night I told him that I wasn't 100% sure, but I did know that I didn't want to consider another child any time in the near future. I was worried he was going to be upset, but he's always been really go with the flow, and said that he is content with just having our daughter. Before I had my daughter I had sort of given up on improving myself at all. My self esteem was destroyed and I was someone who was just trying to survive each day. I had the impression that I could have a child and pour all of the care and improvement and knowledge most people use for themselves into them. When they placed my daughter on my chest I just stared at her for a while, waiting to feel myself morph into someone who could sacrifice all of themselves for this new person. I realized after a few months of being home with her that I was still the same person I was before she existed, and a few years down the line with her confirms it. I also realized that if I give her all and save nothing for me, she sees a sad, burnt-out mother, who is still just trying to survive each day. As she's gotten older and she's become more independent I've realized that the worst thing I could ever do for her is to give up on myself. On top of everything, I've discovered how much I love myself. How much I want to discover what I like in life, besides my family, and how much I deserve to feel happy with myself. I've lived my life thinking that I was a broken/bad person who could only find happiness in others or in things, to distract myself from myself. This post turned into a much longer one than I intended, but I hope parents who have lower self esteem will read this and realize how important they are to their kids and to themselves. I have finally made myself a priority, and I feel giddy about it. I can't wait to watch both me and my daughter grow into happy, emotionally secure people.

I have no clue how he acts like that as at home he's like a storm. We are very affectionate towards him too. We hug him and kiss him so much so I'm happy that he's so gentle (and slightly worried he's overly affectionate) but on the other hand I have a weird feeling in my gut if there is an underlying thing we don't know as kids this age are mostly wild.

Last night at 9 pm he woke up out of a dead sleep and threw up all of his dinner. Poor guy was crying and shaking and obviously not okay. In his vomit I found 3 undigested mini pepperonis. I told my husband, and he said ‚Äúoh yeah, the other kids had those at daycare. He must have accidentally gotten some.‚Äù I got really upset, going on about how I can‚Äôt believe he was given access to those.

I don‚Äôt think other kids should be eating it around him and that she should have chosen a different snack. Am I being too dramatic about this?

My daughter visits him sometimes because she goes with her grandparents (they help me out with childcare sometimes) and the dad lives with them. I‚Äôve been solely responsible for this child. I‚Äôve handled all school and medical choices and expenses. All expenses for her are paid by me. Just everything. That‚Äôs my job. She‚Äôs in private school that I saved money to pay for. Dropping her off at school, taking her to appointments, cooking, cleaning, loving her, all the day to day of parenting - I‚Äôve done.

Didn‚Äôt have anything here for supper and my wife wanted to get out of the house, so she left to go pick something up. I‚Äôm playing guitar while my oldest is playing with cars and my eleven month girl is crawling around. I walk to the kitchen and come back to see her reaching for an outlet. Out of instinct, I yell across the room ‚ÄúNo [her name]!‚Äù She immediately turns around to look at me and lets out one scream and plops down sitting on her butt and sits there with a pouting face and her mouth open like she wants to scream but nothing is coming in or out. Now I‚Äôve seen her do this several times when she hurts herself or gets scared, so I didn‚Äôt think anything about it. I sat down next to her in a chair and looked down at her. She hadn‚Äôt inhaled in a few seconds and I laughed and patted her on the back and lightheartedly said ‚Äúwell breathe baby‚Äù smiling and casual. Her legs in front of her twitched and I dropped the guitar and got in front of her as she collapsed forward.

She started moving her arms and eyes and started screaming which I was overwhelmed but grateful for. My parents live down the road and I called them and told them to come.

It‚Äôs not hard to say, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt hit.‚Äù That is a full sentence. Please, just don‚Äôt be that parent. If I see one of my sons hit yours, they‚Äôre going to be in trouble.

964,Confrontation at the park,"Had been at park for 30 min when 3 older boys showed up (guessing 12 years old) My daughter (6) was playing on the merry go round type structure and each time around she was yelling loudly to my son (4)  ""Hi (sons name)"".  After 6-7 times one of the 3 boys who was 25 feet away was saying  something and I thought I heard the F word, and then started saying ""are you her dad?"" Took a couple times to realize he was talking to me but then I said yes and he said my daughter needed to be quiet.  I said were at the park so I think it's ok.  Then he said a bunch of times she needs to shut the F@$k up.  I said do you just want her not to be so loud, to which he repeated the same thing as before again a few times.  I told him she's just playing and talking to her brother and that I'm sure he and his friends play loud sometimes.  He started approaching at that point and kept repeatedly saying she need to shut the f&@k up.  At this point my daughter was getting a bit sad and scared.I was remaining calm and trying to reason saying it's ok to make noise outside at a park -  but then he kept approaching and lifted his shirt saying ""what do you wanna do about it"" too which I said I just want to talk.  This seemed to calm him for a few seconds.  At this point we are about 4-5 feet apart.  Then he starts looking at my son (both my kids are standing behind me at this point) and saying ""what's he starting at"".  Then he starts talking about ""beating my ass"" and making some fighting / swinging motions, some  to me and also towards my kids.  I told him to stop and that he was scaring them and they are little kids, and he said he didn't give a f@&k and just kept berating us.  My kids were very scared and my son was crying so I told them let's go.  This is about 5-7 minutes after it started.One of the other boys had come over at this point (the 3rd seemed uninterested) and mostly just stood close.  While we were walkinb away and also before I had told him the way he was talking and handling the situation was messed up.  While walking away he took some swings /slaps towards me not really close to contacting me, but eventually did graze my arm while we were leaving.  He sorta retreated after that and we kept walking away.  Both kids were very scared and I was shaken up too and my adrenaline was pumping.  Got back to the car and hugs and told the kids were safe and just ran into someone who was feeling very angry etc. Lots of residual thoughts. I definitely felt some ego and pride in not leaving earlier, feeling like 'we don't need to leave just cause we were being bullied' but I'm not sure that was 100% the right thing to do with my kids there. I didn't feel in too much physical danger as I am larger /stronger physically but the fact that there were 3 of them and the thought of them having a weapon did cross my mind and felt threatening. One side of me wanted to be able to help this boy from acting this way, assuming he was acting in a way that has been modeled in his life, and another side was really upset and wanted to physically restrain him when he was threatening my kids and me. Thinking over it later it seems really screwed up that a kid would do this to smaller kids over something annoying but not a very big deal. Looking for thoughts on how others might have handled the situation and if I maybe should have left earlier. Also looking for thoughts on how / what to talk to my kids about to help them process what happened. Thanks for reading",,False,False,parenting
965,What are some cringeworthy questions your kids have asked you loudly in public?,And how did you respond to to the question? A few recent ones we or friends mentioned: 1.) Why is she dressed like a ghost? - about the middle eastern woman in the store 2.)

966,Can't agree on child's name or circumcision?,"My partner (31m) and I (25f) had an argument that started yesterday when I stated I would like our child to have both our last names hyphenated. We are not married. We both have a child from previous relationships. Both boys. Both 4 years old. I also mentioned I do not plan to have our son together circumcised. My oldest son is not circumcised. This resulted in my partner saying he is done with me and that our beliefs don't align. We have been together for 2 years. Pregnancy was unplanned. I did choose our sons first name to be after my late brother, which my partner was also upset that I had suggested the name and was set on it before discussion although he never initiated conversation on the topic and I asked him for suggestions. Is it really that big of a deal that I want our child to share our last names? I would like my oldest son to share a last name with atleast one sibling. And because circumcision is not medically necessary, I did not opt for it with my oldest and felt it was unnecessary to put him through that. Am I in the wrong? I'm only 10 weeks away from my due date, and now am nervous I will have to go through labor and delivery alone. I understand my partner was upset, I'm just not sure if I'm willing to change my views on these things. His reasoning for being upset is that he isn't ""getting any say"" in these decisions. But he also never tries to discuss them. I am open to his input and opinions. ETA: He did agree to the first name, but then has complained that I chose it. He chose the middle name. He never tries to initiate important conversation revolving our child. Then goes right to threatening to leave and take me to court. His reason for circumcision is that he thinks being uncut is ""gross and weird"" which really hurts my feelings, considering my oldest son is not and he knows this. He is supposed to be dad to my other child as I am mom to his. Their other parents are not involved.",,False,False,parenting

971,Would you allow your 7yo to stay home alone for 15-20 minutes,"Let me give some background information. My 7yo son is SUPER mature for his age. He often gets assumed to be 10 or 11 years old by strangers. He has a phone watch with the ability to push one button to call me. We have alexas in our house, that he can contact me, my husband or my parents who live near by. We have security cameras, smart locks on all of our doors, and smart alarms, so I would be notified if anything went wrong. We live in the BEST neighborhood in the world- seriously, we hate our house, but would never move because our neighborhood is such a close community- we have TONS of neighbors who my son and I trust, his best friends dad is a fire fighter and lives across the street. Our Nextdoor neighbors on both sides are good friends, pretty much any house within 10+ houses of us, in either direction are safe places for him. Our state has no laws in place for how old a kid can be to stay home alone. So with all that said- I like to take the dog for a walk, just around the neighborhood, usually we just do this half mile loop around the house a few times, so I pass by the house every few minutes as I‚Äôd walk. But my son HATES going for our walks, and since school is out, he‚Äôs home all day, and I‚Äôm going crazy not getting my activity in (he has sports and plays so it‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs just lazy, he just thinks it‚Äôs super boring, and it is). Obviously I realize I could just make it fun, and if needed, I will- but he has been begging me to just let him stay home alone. Part of me is like ‚Äúit‚Äôs no different than being in the shower‚Äù I know he will just be using his screen time while I‚Äôm gone, and I have ZERO concerns of him doing something bad- my only concern would be an emergency.

972,I let my daughter go to her first sleepover and she got bit by her best friend‚Äôs dog.,"My daughter is 8. I never thought I would let her go to a sleepover but she and her friend became quickly attached over FaceTime and Minecraft each night after seeing each other all day at school.  My mother makes me feel guilty because my daughter is only 8 and that is too young for a sleepover. The dog bit her hours after I dropped her off, 2 pm in the afternoon, so the sleepover didn‚Äôt happen. The friends mom called me and told me the dog bit her and I immediately drove the 5 minutes to her house and took her to ER. They assessed her bite (she is the worst patient ever) and gave me options. I opted to get her dissolvable stitches. She has one stitch near her mouth, a small puncture wound near that, a scratch on her neck (4 lines wide) on the other side and she said her gums were hanging in her mouth and her tooth felt loose. Dr said they don‚Äôt do anything for inside mouth. I made her a dentist appt today, no dentists were open yesterday. My concern at this point is her tooth, scarring, and her feelings. She seems very down but also said it hurts to smile (and eat). I‚Äôm letting her stay home from school today, to see dentist and to ‚Äúrecover‚Äù, her word. According to her, she went to pet dog (Husky/Elkhound) and it jumped at her. Update- forgot to mention that we did report bite at ER and in our state there is a 2 strikes law with dogs. The owner said he never bit before and she will put him in training. Her husband has been gone a month for work, it‚Äôs his dog and she thought dog was anxious due to that.

976,7 year old son says he doesn‚Äôt want to visit bio Dad anymore. How to handle?,"My 7 year old‚Äôs biological Father has never played a huge role in his life.

Bio Dad has a lot of mental health issues and doesn‚Äôt have the emotional availability to be a full time Dad. When we split, we amicably agreed that I would continue to have full custody and he would continue to see him on weekends. My son has always had reservations about going with his Dad, but lately has been vocalizing them. I am now married to a great guy who is an amazing step father and we have a 2 year old.

He has severe eczema and dairy is his biggest trigger. The rule is don‚Äôt feed him anything that doesn‚Äôt come from my kitchen. Everything in there is safe. Babysitters are free to eat anything they want from the kitchen. I just can‚Äôt risk bringing outside food into the house.

He‚Äôs been through hell with his skin his whole life and the slightest itch or dry spot makes him flip out. He saw me get the cream out tonight and worked himself in a panic at the sight. This isn‚Äôt just being itchy, this is emotionally traumatic for him. I had to drag the truth out of my niece. She stuck to it until her mom made her tell me the truth. She‚Äôs watched him for years, I don‚Äôt know how she could act so foolish. I trusted her totally. Obviously I‚Äôll never let her watch him again. She keeps calling me to try and talk about it and I can‚Äôt deal with it right now. Her mom says she feels awful but I‚Äôm trying to focus on my son and I can‚Äôt deal with her feelings. How am I going to handle this with her when I calm down? If she were just a babysitter I‚Äôd just yell and fire her but she‚Äôs my niece. I‚Äôm very angry with her but I still love her.

978,Dropped the ball (literally),"My wife and I totally fucked up.

Just because of life circumstances, we never got around to scheduling her medical physical. Now, we are two days past the signup deadline, and the school is offering NO flexibility -- i.e., she can't try out this year. This was 100% our fault, and I feel like a shitty parent. How do I move forward without over-correcting? Like, I KNOW she is going to be crushed, and I KNOW it's our fault.

She said it was okay, and that it just gave her more time to practice for next year.

979,Thankful for other parents,"So yesterday I picked up my two kids from daycare after work. About 45 minutes before I got there my 1.5 year old fell into the fence on the playground, causing a lump and a bruise. Not even the biggest lump he‚Äôs had. He was acting fine but on the way home he threw up twice in the car. Call my husband and we decide to take him to urgent care to make sure it‚Äôs not a concussion. Urgent care sends us next door to the pediatric ER. My husband meets us there but they only let one parent at a time so he collects our oldest and heads home. My kid throws up a bit again. Couple of hours later he has our BIL watch our oldest while he brings us a bag of toys, clothes and food. I try to give him a little bit of the food to see if he will hold it down. He doesn‚Äôt. Thankfully he just throws up a little and I was able to catch it in a vomit bag. Fast forward some more and it‚Äôs now about an hour past his bedtime. We‚Äôve been weaning him off bottles but my husband packed him one. I try that to see if I can get him to sleep with the bottle. By the way, we are still in the waiting room. He‚Äôs fine for about an hour. I move to a quiet corner to help him get to sleep. Doesn‚Äôt work. I sit him in the chair next to me and then he throws up again. A LOT. All over him, the chair, some on me. There were two moms sitting nearest to us, one with a 9ish year old boy and one with a 11ish year old girl. I focus on patting my kids back and having him lean forward. Boy mom jumps up and runs off. Her son found a box of tissues and is handing me tissues. Girl mom ran to the front to tell the staff my little one was throwing up. Boy mom comes back with handfuls of paper towels from the bathroom. Girl mom brings me some damp paper towels. I strip my kid of his clothes and boy mom gives me a plastic bag from her purse to put all the icky clothes in. The son then spent time playing peekaboo with my kid, making him laughing smile after. Couple of hours later, still waiting and now I‚Äôm feeling shaky because I haven‚Äôt eaten the food my husband packed for me because my get was already hangry and watching me eat would have had him screaming his lungs out. I also hadn‚Äôt eaten in close to 12 hours. These two moms and the son kept my kids attention so I could stand behind him and sneak bites. I will forever be grateful for people who see others in need and jump in to help, even if it‚Äôs just bringing paper towels and playing peekaboo.",,False,False,parenting

My wife is in a dire need a break and I am 100% on board with her getting her alone time but we have a momma's boy (2.5 years old) who will stop at nothing to get to her if he wants to while she is at home. No amount of distracting, talking to him, screen time, food etc. will stop him from wanting to the crawl all over her. I don't want to yell at him. I realized that its not my responsibility how my wife takes a break. I can do what I can to corral our toddler but if he wants her he will go to hell and back to get her while she is home. Right now its really hard because he is sick so I can't get him out of the house. If he wasn't sick I could be out for a couple hours but that is about as much as he can tolerate. Now I am more worried about taking him out (covid). I have options but they are limited. We have the means for her to get a hotel on the weekend if need be to just be ALONE but she chooses not to. She tells me she is burnt out/needs alone time/needs sleep. My thought it is that if you want true ALONE TIME; the person who wants that time needs to remove themselves.
