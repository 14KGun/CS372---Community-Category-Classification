6,"Tipping culture in America, gone wild?","We just returned from the US and I felt obliged to tip nearly everyone for everything! Restaurants, ok I get it.. the going rate now is 18% minimum so it’s not small change. We were paying $30 minimum on top of each meal. It was asking if we wanted to tip at places where we queued up and bought food from the till, the card machine asked if we wanted to tip 18%, 20% or 25%. This is what I don’t understand, I’ve queued up, placed my order, paid for a service which you will kindly provide.. ie food and I need to tip YOU for it? Then there’s cabs, hotel staff, bar staff, even at breakfast which was included they asked us to sign a blank $0 bill just so we had the option to tip the staff. So wait another $15 per day? Are US folk paid worse than the UK? I didn’t find it cheap over there and the tipping culture has gone mad to me.",,False,False,travel

12,Egypt Trip 2021: Biggest mistake of my life,"I just got home from a 2 week trip to Egypt where I went to Cairo/Luxor/Sharm El Sheikh with a group of friends. Dear god, what a mistake. If this post can deter anybody from going and spending money in this country, it served its purpose. I’ve never been anywhere where the general population was so misogynistic and disrespectful to women. You are completely and blatantly lied to and ripped off by everyone everywhere - regardless of how “savvy” of a traveler you think you are. When you are not dealing with that you are battling constant food poisoning despite ""playing it safe"" and eating in the higher end hotels (Sofitel, Marriott, etc). The street food in Southeast Asia is safer. The joke is truly on the tourists who choose to come here. Want to go to the Pyramids? Prepare to get harassed and haggled into getting on a dying horse that will be beaten and whipped to keep moving. Want to go inside the Pyramids? Prepare to be cornered and shaken down for everything in your wallet. The same goes for Karnak and The Valley of the Kings in Luxor. Make sure you don’t go into any corners or tight spots because the people “working” there will block you and make you pay them. Sharm El Sheikh? If you are a diver than the red sea is beautiful, everything else including the hotel is an absolute Russian wasteland (my wife is Russian I can say this). Think it’s cheap? Speak English and your prices are pinged to the dollar. Even the doctor at the Sofitel in Cairo will charge you $300 USD for a covid test (costs around $80 USD everywhere else). I consider myself a savvy traveler and I have been all over the middle east, some places better than others. This is the worst place I have ever been to and I highly recommend you pick another destination. A real tragedy for 50% of Egyptians who are nice people, because the other 50% have ruined the country. I am a male in my 30's.",,False,False,travel

27,Went to Egypt and it was just as terrible yet gorgeous as everyone described,"Went to Cairo and Luxor for 4 days total and quite honestly it was enough for me. From the moment we landed to the moment we left- Endless street harassment! For what it’s worth- we’re seasoned travelers who have been to over 20 countries, and coming from an even poorer country myself it was appalling the level of antagonizing we got while there! To start of with the good- I have never seen anything as incredible as the pyramids, or the temples in Luxor. Like I couldn’t wrap my head around how something that beautiful and precise count have been made. Especially Hatshepsut temple. Definitely worthy of all the bad we endured. But holy hell, my partner and I were saying how, at the end of 4 days, we would never want to go back. The usual camel hawkers and the knee selling junky items for 10x the price didn’t bother us. We got a tour guide which was fine but he went so fast. So we came back the next day on our own to try and slow down and enjoy. Well we were walking around and an official looking guy in a suit blew his whistle and was like “ticket”? To which already paid. He went on the whole spiel about how he’s a friend, waved us through , and then tried to push us through the”correct “ pathway. We followed and of course immediately cornered us and asked for money. Gave him $5 usd and he was like “give me more. I see another $5” to which we refused. To anyone who said we should have been smarter- there’s a ton of police around the pyramids, if someone blows a whistle at you, you stop and comply; you don’t expect it to be some scumbag. The most egregious one was in the airport, we had to pass a tunnel to get to our terminal. It was really early so it as just my partner running around. An official airport security man asked for his passport (normal) where he was going , and at the end REFUSED TO GIVE THE PASSPORT BACK AND JUST HELD OUT HIS HAND EXPECTING MONEY. Said nothing, because he knew my partner was alone and would not make a fuss.gave him $1 usd bc he was holding the passport hostage and again he had the audacity to say, that’s it? We had people follow us for several hundred feet to our car asking us to buy shit. That’s annoying as hell and out of sheer spite I refused to buy anything.  The whole dropping you off at some crappy papyrus/essence/stone store at the end of the tour put a really bad taste in my mouth although I know we could say no. EVERYONE was all “my friend my friend” but no one treated us with genuine kindness when we needed help. We ran out of cash but only had a credit card-  no one at the bank would help. We desperately asked a restaurant- well they did, but at a 15% fee AND MORE TIP FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE on top of that. Knowing damn well the actual cash advance fee is 5% at most and they pocketed the rest. Then they have their women and children monopolizing most toilets, handing you paper towels you didn’t ask for in one hand, hand out reached for tip in another. For effing paper towels that I can just get myself. Unfortunately my pity for them is mixed with resentment and anger. Poverty is no reason to be dishonorable, that is an absolute insult to poor people everywhere.",,False,False,travel

435,Why I will never use Airbnb anymore and you shouldn't too.,"I won't write long and just be brief about the whole Airbnb experience over the last 1-2 years. I enjoyed using Airbnb for more than 7 years, and now it has come to a point that I will never use it. In the beginning, Airbnb was more organic and personal experience where you could actually enjoy staying in the hosts' place.  However, now the airbnb is filled with hosts that are just in it for the business and doesn't deliver the adequate service or experience that it used to be. Most of the places aren't well equipped or are vacant, and most of the places are just vacant housing that has not been rented out yet. And whenever face this kind of issue, the host doesn't take any responsibility. And when you reach out to Airbnb about this issue, their attitude before was ""let me see how I can help you"" to now ""too bad. we can't do anything about it."" or ""we will try to help you out, and see the solution"" and no answer. Prices are way overpriced compared to the price index of the countries I have visited. For example, when I visited Ukraine, Peru, Colombia, and Spain, the daily rent prices were about 5-6x rate of the monthly rent price rate. Which I think it way too overpriced.  Personally, I have been using Airbnb while I traveled in the past 1.5 years, traveling to about 6 countries: Ukraine, Portugal, United States, Spain, Colombia, and Peru. I had multiple experiences where I checked into the listing that looked a lot different from the photo and doesn't have even a basic amenities, like hot shower, wifi, electronics. I had an experience where I checked into the listing that the host said it's a ""bit"" noisy, but the noise pollution was too extreme to the point that I felt like I was sleeping on a highway street, because the wall has an open air. I messaged host about this, and he ignored my messages. I contacted Airbnb support, and was on the phone line for hours trying to deliver my struggle of insomnia due to noise pollution and that I couldn't sleep for 2 days, and had to check out early from the listing. I think I lost about $400~ already from the listings that didn't have amenities it described, or even fails to deliver the basic needs of what it can be actually called an ""housing service"" Anyways, the Airbnb support really doesn't care or help the customer, at least based on my experience. I don't know what your experience is. But Airbnb is now filled with hosts that deliver the services or amenity with really poor quality listing, mostly the properties that has not been rented out, for extremely high price. If you guys could give me alternatives to Airbnb I would appreciate it. I'm sick of this money grabbing host and tech company that doesn't care about customer. Edit: some people keep saying do the diligence of reading reviews and research, and I do research listings 3-4 hours before I make a booking, and all the bad experiences happened in listings with over 4 stars. And I left 1 star reviews and it would never show up on the listing after few weeks. So there is really a loophole where host controls the review somehow that I do not know about (report to Airbnb for removal, etc)",,False,False,travel

495,I want to cast my old wedding ring into the exposed lava of an active volcano; where and how can I make this happen. Budget flexible.,"Presumably a helicopter would be the way to go but idk anything about all that. Given the provenance of my flyer miles something on the Pacific Rim would be preferable, but open to pretty much any destination and timeframe. EDIT: Obligatory RIP my inbox. Thanks everyone for the levity and suggestions. While here, let me address a few common topics: As it happens, I'm a man, not a woman. Not offended at the mistake of course but intensely curious as to why the overwhelming assumption was the opposite. If anyone cares to share their thought process on that I'd be interested. This isn't about my ex-wife. I have no intention of ever mentioning it to her. We've been apart for many years now and frankly I don't think about her almost at all any more. But the ring. The ring still haunts me. It is a burden on my breath, even when tucked away out of sight. I can feel the warp of it in the drawer where it is kept. It is fraught with the weight of lost love; of tearful promises made in joy, now broken; of the sacred willing itself into the profane. My wife is gone and my youth with her. Under the stars, before the dawn, we forged something beautiful and, yes, I invested in it some piece of my soul, now broken off, still somehow bound up in the ring. I cannot bear to keep it. Neither can I treat this sign of faith, this artefact from out of time, this link to an otherwise-irretrievable self, so cavalierly as to pawn it or throw it away as some have suggested. To do that would be to dishonor all that was good and holy. No; it demands a fitting end, commensurate with its gravitas. Thankfully, there is established procedure for disposing of lifeforce-infused soul-wearying rings. Yes I'm overstating things for the bit. Really, I'm mostly okay. And I do think this will tip the matter over the edge, as it were -- wrap things up with a grand, wry flourish, and have a great story to tell afterward. For real tho I didn't realize the lava may not be hot enough; thanks for that tip. A friend has advised me to reach out to university volcanology departments who will know the ins and outs of such things and may be willing to deposit it appropriately for me, with video evidence. Oh, and FWIW, I'd estimate the actual value of this ring at somewhere in the $50 range, maybe, if a buyer could even be found. Means a lot to me obviously but it's not especially remarkable. I was a child when I bought it and had a child's budget. It's 'white gold'. Also, for those of you angry about my intent to litter by placing a miniscule amount of gold in the firestorm of an active volcano, I've got worse news for you: Later today I'm gonna go discard some apple cores in the forest behind my house. There is nothing you can do. The plan is already in motion (my daughter's finishing the last apple up as I type this) and I will not negotiate.",,False,False,travel

If you don't have it,these 'police' will try to fine you.They will even offer you a lower fine if you pay in cash,on the spot. Obviously in this scam, they are not real police.They just want your money.

512,Please be patient and self sufficient if you visit US National Parks this year,"I'm not sure how much people are aware of this outside the Park Service, so I wanted to make transparent an internal issue we're going through right now. Across the board, almost all divisions in almost all parks, we are seeing major hiring problems. The Park Service cannot fill positions, some parks are going into seasons with half or less their normal staff. I work in a large, recognizable park and we are short maintenance, interpretation, law enforcement, and medical staff. We will be down ambulances, trash service will be less frequent, there will be fewer educators to staff buildings or lead programs, fewer hands on deck to handle emergencies. This is the byproduct of a lot of issues, from the ongoing unpleasantness, to the fact that the majority of front-line jobs are held by seasonal workers who simply don't exist anymore, to low pay, to some ongoing HR issues that limit the applicant pool. Overall we're hiring from a smaller pool than ever, for more jobs than ever, and we're going into Spring and Summer with staffs smaller than 2019, with higher visitation than ever. I will not suggest you cancel visits, but be aware that services might not be as fast, and that facilities might be closed or have reduced hours. Be aware that you might be on your own if you're visiting during peak season and get into trouble. Be ready for more traffic jams, longer lines, and fewer services. Please be ready to pack your trash out as much as possible because less than ever will we have staff to clean up litter. Be especially careful if you're doing anything that could cause a fire, because fire staff are just as short staffed as everyone else and a lot of the country is in a pretty major drought. We want to go back to normal, but we don't have the staff to do that yet. We already deal with a lot of people at their worst, on their worst days. We don't get paid much, but we love our jobs for the most part. This situation isn't going to get better until next year at the earliest, and if there isn't motion on the root causes for this staffing problem, we might not see improvement then either. I'm not acting as a representative of the NPS here, but I hope you'll listen to this bottom rung, currently furloughed, tired Park Ranger all the same. So TLDR: please be chill this summer. We know this might be your one chance to visit these amazing places, but we're basically boned, we're going to be tired, we're going to be dealing with a lot. We want to help, but we need you to help yourselves too. *EDIT for clarity and a spelling mistake",,False,False,travel

538,The Friends We Met,"As I approach 33 years old, now married with kids, a home, and deeply planted domestic roots near where I grew up, I occasionally find myself washing the dishes, and thinking of a friend I made in a foreign country while traveling alone, who I never talked to again, who I knew almost nothing about. And who was my best friend for a day. I think about you, the so many of you, more often than I think of the kids I went to school with. We were better friends for a few hours than some people I've spent years around. I had more human connection standing in line to buy coffee in a Swiss alleyway with you than I've had with coworkers I sat next to for 2 years. Let's be honest, I wouldn't remember your name, let alone recognize you if we bumped into each other on the street. When I think of you, I don't see a face. I see a night out exploring the streets of Rome, and a bunch of overpriced roses for tourists we bought to give to strangers. I hear all twenty of us singing on that Colombian beach in the terrible Spanish we all managed to learn in a few days. I feel the clink of beer glasses in a dingy bar where we were surprised to find someone else who spoke clear English. I didn't know then what you did for work, or who you were in high school, or what you did when you weren't exploring the world. I didn't know what baggage you carried, or what your life back home was like. All I knew was ""here's a human worth being around, worth sharing a bit of the world with"". And that's how I think of you now. Someone I shared a bit of my world with, who ceased to exist the day you flew home and so did I. We hugged, knowing ""there goes a friend I'll never know again"", and that was absolutely fine. And now, we're both washing the dishes, with the laughter of our children in the background, and our spouses walking by to give us a kiss - happier than we could have ever imagined with the lives we've built. But still, occasionally thinking of the friends we met. I hope you're all happy and well.",,False,False,travel

547,Cruises suck! Never again.,"Just to give some context, Ive mostly solo traveled. I started in Europe at 19, then did the typical SEA backpack trip in my 20s and then I met my amazing GF who never really traveled much except on a few cruises.  Together we’ve traveled Europe and Mexico, from hostels, to Airbnb’s, to all-inclusive. Ive done it all. She however has kids and insisted this was the easiest and most affordable way to travel with them. We did a cruise in 2018 and now, here I am, 2:30am reluctantly cruising off the coast of Nassau. Last month she and I were sailing the San Blas Islands from Panama to Colombia. It was incredible.  Yeah we got a little sea sick, it was slow going, cramped and we got heat rash but it was an absolute adventure. The other passengers were so fun, the captain, his wife and the crew were amazing to travel with. We both agreed that it was a trip of a lifetime. Now I’m on a boat, emitting plumes of black toxic fumes in the air and who know what I’m the ocean, with 3000 other people, who seem to have nothing more interesting going on in their lives other than talking about the last cruise they were on. The two swimming pools were so hazy from the crowds of people drinking and probably pissing in it that our kids didn’t even want to swim in it. “But,” the cruisers tell you, “you just picked the wrong cruise line!” No, no I didn’t. Sure the food is better on Princess cruises, but the food isn’t the problem.  It’s the waste, it’s the awful working conditions, it’s the sheer amount of pollution cruise lines produce, the people, omg the people, with their matching cruise themed shirts… it’s tacky.  Cruising is a culture I want no part of and I’m so ashamed I’m participating in it.   Trying Disney or Holland America won’t change that. And for the record, I totally get the difference between vacationing and traveling. Not every vacation needs to be some exotic adventure to some jungle village, but this isn’t exactly relaxing either. There is nothing a cruise offers that is better than an all inclusive resort or a nice rental on the beach. Cruising is not cheaper either that’s for damn sure. And if you tell me you cruise so you can see multiple destinations in one trip I’ll tell you you’re a fool. Going zip lining or swimming with dolphins for 3 hours isn’t seeing anything. You’re on a floating Reno NV grade casino. For those that only cruise I beg you to step outside your comfort zone for just once and consider a less wasteful way of traveling.  I can’t take back my actions, I’m as guilty as the rest of them but I’ll say this… after two cruises I’ll never go again. Apologies for any typos, it’s late and I’m on my phone. /rant.

623,"28 years old, $30k in the bank thinking about dropping it all and going traveling for the next 2-3 years.","Anyone do something similar? Did you regret it. Im thinking of traveling south east asia for the next 2-3 years(how ever long my money lasts) just to get away from everything I guess. I put aside an additional $5k so taht I have something to fall back to when I get back(My mom also said I could stay with her so no rent) but I figure why not do it. I dont have a family, or a girlfriend or anything thats really keeping me in my country. I want to get out and see part of the world at least if possible. Ive done some research and what not and figure I can stretch it to maybe 4 years if I need to. Who knows maybe ill meet a girl along the way, but if not no big deal just travel and chill. Thinking of doing longer stays like 90 days in thailand so I was just going to rent an apartment or w.e its called and use that as a home base type situation and then take overnight buses to the different towns for a few days and then come back to home base. So yeah anyone do something similar? How was it? I feel like if I dont do it now while im still youngish I'll never be able to do it. I work a dead end job where there isnt much room for growth or anything so leaving that doesnt really matter. Nothing that interested me once does now so it seems like the perfect time. I'd live cheap as possible, I dont really drink so beer isnt an expernse I need, id eat street food as often as possible, or even cook in the apartment a few times a week to save money. Maybe even get a tent and camp out at beaches if possible. I created a google sheet where I laid out my plan and I feel like i could really do this. Kind of rambling now so Ima just post Edit: i am going to wait until covid is over to do this, or at least its a little better out there lol. Should of included this in the original post my bad people",,False,False,travel

This has been my experience so far for a three day trip: The Louvre asked me to make an account to purchase a ticket. I had to set up a password and received a total of 5 emails for what is -in all honesty- a once in a decade purchase. I booked the train. Another dozen of emails. My hotel I booked through their own website (no booking.com). Literally every day, they emailed me to ask me to review my stay. They wouldn't let me check out without providing yet another review and newsletter subscription.

662,I traveled to Italy this week and wanted to share the process of getting there and back,"I’m American and went to Italy for work. For those curious, the process was that I had to fill out an EU document about my travel, pre-order a CDC approved covid test (BinaxNOW home test), and register for a covid test for my arrival to Italy. Being that it was a quickly booked work trip days prior to departure, I filled out this info with just 2 days to spare but had no issues. The at home kit comes via FedEx within 24 hours to your house. I am unsure if this information is easily intuitive or not, as it was provided to me as mandatory steps in an email by the vendor. When I got to the airport (EWR) to travel to Italy, I had to take a covid test. I believe there are 3 airports nationally that have on site covid testing stations. Took about an hour to stand in line, check in, take the test, and wait for my results, so give yourself ample time ahead of your flight. Pro tip is to register ahead of time. They were very busy and I saw folks get turned away because appointment times were full for the day. This test is also $200 and not covered by insurance. Another observation was that folks were showing up confused that they were turned away from TSA because they didn’t take the right covid test ahead of time. You can take the CDC rapid test mentioned above at home instead of opting for a testing station at the airport, just make sure to order the correct one. I’m unsure as to which test folks may have taken that was incorrect. It could also be the window time their test was taken in was expired. Upon getting my results, I was able to check in through TSA for my flight. Upon arrival to Italy, I immediately had to take another test. This test was $25. They held onto my passport during the waiting period and when I got negative results, I was then able to proceed to customs. To come back to America, I had to take the at home test kit I had purchased and brought ahead of time. You can only buy them in bulk (6 or more, cost is $150) So I now have 5 tests for future flights. I had a doctor watch me take the test digitally on my laptop in my hotel. The process took about 30 minutes. They then sent me official approval via email that I had to upload to my airline app in order to check in again. It is valid for 72 hours and has to be done within that window time prior to your flight. The airport was very serious about checking that this test has been taken so don’t forget to buy this test and bring it with you. I was never asked if I was vaccinated (I am) but I traveled with my card just in case. I hope that provides some insight on what the immediate future of travel looks like to certain countries! EDIT: Added cost of European test EDIT 2: Since folks are asking, here are all the forms I filled out and links to tests for this trip via United Airlines:",,False,False,travel

665,What city have you travelled to you that really surprised you.,"Like the title says. What city have you travelled to that really surprised you. Good or bad. I've been to many cities across Canada and the U.S, but one really surprised me, even though people have told me and my wife many times that we should go, after all it is only a 5 hour drive from where we live near London, Ontario, Canada. So on June 7h 2019 in the spur of the moment, we travelled to Chicago. Our toddler aged daughter was spending a few weeks up at my in law's cottage. We were going to join her soon but we had 2 full weeks to ourselves so for the weekend we booked the Hilton in Chicago and planned on walking as much of it as we could, and literally used recommendations and our drive to plan it out. When we arrived at the Hilton hotel, it was quite late around 10pm since we both drove after work. So went to a bar for a surprisingly great meal spur of the moment. The next day, we set off. Honestly, if you've never been, do it some day! The people there were fantastic, the food was epic, and architectural boat tour was great. We walked over 15 miles on foot to all the different things we wanted to see, and to our surprise Jazzfest was on for free in Chicago.  It actually costs quite a bit to attend in the Canadian cities I've lived in, so that in itself was a treat. After a long day, we made our way to Wrigley Field for an evening Cubs game. Bucket list item checked! It was so much better than I hoped for, and the locals that were season ticket holders learned came from Canada and were so friendly. We traded stories with a few couples randomly, and best of all the Cubs won one of the best games I've ever seen, in an amazing park that has to be experienced. I'm not writer. If you've read my ramblings this long, thanks!? Our view in Wrigley Field. They smashed the Cardinals that day. Look up the game recap on Youtube. Cubs vs Cardinals June 8 2019.",,False,False,travel

Was thinking of doing cheaper places like south east Asia, eastern Europe, and south America. Anyone have experience doing it? Did you regret it, or did you regret not doing it? Might try to start a youtube to try and fund more traveling(I know it's oversaturated and I'm sorry lol). I just am so tired of the same God dam thing everyday waking up to the depressing news, going to a depressing retail job, going home to play video games and watch anime until I collapse from exhaustion and the doing it all over again. Figure this would be a once in a life time trip I'm in a decent age where u still have time ti start a family if I want when I get back. I'm not educated so I can't get a good job any way and figure when else in my life will I have the money and the time ya know? It's literally either this or I'm joining the air force lol.

I just don't know what to do besides opening a credit card dispute, but, because I don't have a picture of the keys in the car, I don't know how helpful that would be. My only other thought is to get surveillance footage, but I can't get a hold of anyone at the SFO branch. Anyone had a similar issue or got any advice? Does everyone take pictures of the keys inside the car and I'm just a novice for not doing that? Thanks in advance. tldr: Avis is charging me $450 for lost keys that were placed in the center cupholder of the car. I don't know how to argue that it was in there.",,False,False,travel
785,Would you be willing to fly on an airline that allows pets in the cabin?,"Context, this is originally based off of a post in r/dogs talking about the want/need for flights that don’t force pets into cargo where it can be very dangerous even life threatening. There have been arguments of course for an against pets in cargo but most people against are saying there just isn’t demand and only pet obsessed people would use it. Which is why I turned to this sub. You people who love to travel, how would you feel about a flight like this? I envision the plane being half seats and half kennels. Seats are very economy priced, with kennels being a bit pricier. The kennels have auto locks after boarding that can only be disabled by flight crew before disembarking. There could be dogs, cats, or small animals in the kennels but proof of vaccination would be required. There is no way for animals to be loose in the cabin during flight with the auto locking kennel doors. Pet owners can visit their pets in the back of the plane as they wish but the kennel doors can’t open. Human seats are discounted for having to deal with animal noise, so it’s a way to travel super cheap if you don’t have pets as long as you’re willing to deal with them on the flight.

They are all over you harrassing you, and if you do decide to buy something, they will always try to scam you in some way. Everyone I met there was trying to scam you or somehow get money from you. People would try to trick you into accepting favors or anything, and then want money afterwards. You can not trust anybody. Even stores/places I thought were reputable could not be trusted and they would try any method to pry more money from you. I have never experienced anything like it. And random people such as security guards in airports would also try to get a tip for just standing there/letting you past them. They just see that you are a tourist and see you as a walking ATM that is okay to scam or pry money from. And the men there will not leave a woman alone, they are constantly trying to talk to you or disrupting you, every single second. It is incredibly annoying. I am glad to be home.",,False,False,travel

The meals should be organic & healthy. This isn't a holiday but a spiritual time for myself to kinda reinvent, reconsider, reborn and reflect. Break free from this toxic, boring routine.

981,Travel fatigue,"Hey everyone, I’m just here to let you know that if you’re on a long trip and you’re tired and you want to go home, that is okay! Travel is usually something we do because we want to, we enjoy it, and we want to make lasting memories from it. My boyfriend and I have been traveling in Europe for ten weeks and we are cutting our trip a few weeks short because we are exhausted and nearly out of money. This is his first time leaving the states (yes I know, a ballsy move on my part to take him on a three month journey) and he is feeling like he’s giving up by us going home early. I keep trying to tell him that we aren’t trapped here, and that we are supposed to be doing this because we want to. We’ve had a great time so far, with ups and downs obviously, but we are tired now, and that’s okay. Travel fatigue is real and no one should feel pressured to be seeing and doing amazing things 24/7 just because you feel like you have to. Down days are okay. Sick days abroad are okay. We are still human and still prone to our same issues that we have at home. Anxiety and depression don’t go away just because we leave our environment. I hope someone can read this and know that everyone feels it, and it’s a normal thing.",,False,False,travel

983,So ... what's the consensus on travel right now? Is it irresponsible?,"Hi everyone. My husband and I (who are triple vaxxed) are supposed to leave on a surf trip to Panama and Costa Rica next week, but I'm having some doubts. Both countries have pretty decent vaccination rates, but I can't help but feel it's irresponsible traveling right now due to the surge. But there's also a part of me who feels that we've been responsible this whole time and this may be the new normal for the foreseeable future, so we should take opportunities to travel when we can. I don't want to be a jerk and travel if it's bad to do so but I've also seen conflicting messaging from physicians and health experts. I just don't know what to do and would love to hear from you all on what you think. Thanks so much in advance.",,False,False,travel

Notice that the price hasn't gone down to make up for the reduced service?",,False,False,travel
