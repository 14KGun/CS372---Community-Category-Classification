6,"Tipping culture in America, gone wild?","We just returned from the US and I felt obliged to tip nearly everyone for everything! Restaurants, ok I get it.. the going rate now is 18% minimum so it‚Äôs not small change. We were paying $30 minimum on top of each meal. It was asking if we wanted to tip at places where we queued up and bought food from the till, the card machine asked if we wanted to tip 18%, 20% or 25%. This is what I don‚Äôt understand, I‚Äôve queued up, placed my order, paid for a service which you will kindly provide.. ie food and I need to tip YOU for it? Then there‚Äôs cabs, hotel staff, bar staff, even at breakfast which was included they asked us to sign a blank $0 bill just so we had the option to tip the staff. So wait another $15 per day? Are US folk paid worse than the UK? I didn‚Äôt find it cheap over there and the tipping culture has gone mad to me.",,False,False,travel
